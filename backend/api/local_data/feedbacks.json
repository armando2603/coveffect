Our study also confirms that older age and comorbidity increase the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19."}, {"timestamp": "Wed May 18 2022 12:20:02 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "test_set", "value": "higher", "attribute": "level", "doi": "10.3389/fmed.2021.780611", "cord_uid": "3tmkaxdd", "abstract": "Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Delta variant (B.1.617.2) has been responsible for the current increase in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infectivity rate worldwide. We compared the impact of the Delta variant and non-Delta variant on the COVID-19 outcomes in patients from Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces, Indonesia. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we ascertained 161 patients, 69 with the Delta variant and 92 with the non-Delta variant. The Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer was used to perform the whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Results: The mean age of patients with the Delta variant and the non-Delta variant was 27.3 \u00b1 20.0 and 43.0 \u00b1 20.9 (p = 3 \u00d7 10(\u22126)). The patients with Delta variant consisted of 23 males and 46 females, while the patients with the non-Delta variant involved 56 males and 36 females (p = 0.001). The Ct value of the Delta variant (18.4 \u00b1 2.9) was significantly lower than that of the non-Delta variant (19.5 \u00b1 3.8) (p = 0.043). There was no significant difference in the hospitalization and mortality of patients with Delta and non-Delta variants (p = 0.80 and 0.29, respectively). None of the prognostic factors were associated with the hospitalization, except diabetes with an OR of 3.6 (95% CI = 1.02\u201312.5; p = 0.036). Moreover, the patients with the following factors have been associated with higher mortality rate than the patients without the factors: age \u226565 years, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease with the OR of 11 (95% CI = 3.4\u201336; p = 8 \u00d7 10(\u22125)), 27 (95% CI = 6.1\u2013118; p = 1 \u00d7 10(\u22125)), 15.6 (95% CI = 5.3\u201346; p = 6 \u00d7 10(\u22127)), 12 (95% CI = 4\u201335.3; p = 1.2 \u00d7 10(\u22125)), and 6.8 (95% CI = 2.1\u201322.1; p = 0.003), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age \u226565 years, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension were the strong prognostic factors for the mortality of COVID-19 patients with the OR of 3.6 (95% CI = 0.58\u201321.9; p = 0.028), 16.6 (95% CI = 2.5\u2013107.1; p = 0.003), 5.5 (95% CI = 1.3\u201323.7; p = 0.021), and 5.8 (95% CI = 1.02\u201332.8; p = 0.047), respectively.

The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more stable and infectious after storage at \u221220\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C. Particularly, the S-G614 variant was found to be more stable than the S-D614 variant. The spike protein of the S-G614 variant had better binding ability with the ACE2 receptor than that of the S-D614 variant after storage at \u221220\u00b0C for up to 30 days. Our findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, and their stability and infectivity up to 30 days depends on the spike variant. Stability and infectivity are related to each other, and the higher stability of S-G614 compared to that of S-D614 may contribute to rapid viral spread of the S-G614 variant. IMPORTANCE It has been observed that variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more stable and infectious after storage at \u221220\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C. A SARS-CoV-2 S-D614G variant is currently the most dominant variant in circulation and is associated with enhanced infectivity. We compared the stability of two SARS-CoV-2 variants: the early S-D614 variant carrying the D614 spike protein and the new S-G614 variant carrying the G614 spike protein, stored at both 4\u00b0C and \u221220\u00b0C for different periods. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, which further depends on the spike variant, that is, the ability of the spike protein to bind with the ACE2 receptor with higher efficiency. The high stability of the S-G614 variant also explains its rapid spread and infectivity.

Since the onset of infections, several full-length sequences of viral genome have been made available which have been used to gain insights into viral dynamics. We utilised a meta-data driven comparative analysis tool for sequences (Meta-CATS) algorithm to identify mutations in 829 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from around the world. The algorithm predicted sixty-one mutations among SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We observed that most of the mutations were concentrated around three protein coding genes viz nsp3 (non-structural protein 3), RdRp (RNA-directed RNA polymerase) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We used various computational tools including normal mode analysis (NMA), C-\u03b1 discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (MD) to study the effect of mutations on functionality, stability and flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins including envelope (E), N and spike (S) proteins.

Methods RdRp target delay (RTD) in the Seegene AllplexTM 2019-nCoV PCR assay is a proxy marker for the Delta variant. The absence of this proxy marker in the transition period was used to identify suspected Omicron infections. Cox regression was performed for the outcome of hospital admission in those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the Seegene AllplexTM assay from 1 November to 14 December 2021 in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, public sector. Vaccination status and prior diagnosed infection, were adjusted for. Results 150 cases with RTD and 1486 cases without RTD were included. Cases without RTD had a lower hazard of admission (adjusted Hazard Ratio [aHR] of 0.56, 95%CI 0.34-0.91). Complete vaccination was protective of admission with an aHR of 0.45 (95%CI 0.26-0.77). Conclusion Omicron has resulted in a lower risk of hospital admission, compared to contemporaneous Delta infection, when using the proxy marker of RTD.

The sequenced viral genome varied from the already submitted sequences from Pakistan thereby confirming that slightly different viruses were causing infections during different time periods in Karachi. All belonged to GH clade with D614G, P323L and Q57H mutations. The virus from second wave had A222V mutation making it more different. This information can be useful in selecting or designing a vaccine."}, {"timestamp": "Mon May 30 2022 13:01:18 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "test_set", "value": "unaffected", "attribute": "level", "doi": "10.1002/jmv.27451", "cord_uid": "mvqyaalk", "abstract": "The appearance of emerging variants of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 carrying mutations into the spike protein has recently raised concern with respect to tracking their transmission and mitigating the impact in the evolving pandemic across countries.

Remdesivir (RDV, VEKLURY\u00ae) is a nucleoside analog prodrug and the first FDA-approved antiviral treatment of COVID-19. Here we present a comprehensive antiviral activity assessment of RDV and its parent nucleoside, GS-441524, against 10 current and former SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOI clinical isolates by nucleoprotein ELISA and plaque reduction assay. Delta and Omicron variants remained susceptible to RDV and GS-441524, with EC50 values 0.31 to 0.62-fold of those observed against the ancestral WA1 isolate. All other tested variants exhibited EC50 values ranging from 0.15 to 2.3-fold of the observed EC50 values against WA1. Analysis of nearly 6 million publicly available variant isolate sequences confirmed that Nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) target of RDV and GS-441524, is highly conserved across variants with only 2 prevalent changes (P323L and G671S). Using recombinant viruses, both RDV and GS-441524 retained potency against all viruses containing frequent variant substitutions or their combination. Taken together, these results highlight the conserved nature of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 and provide evidence of sustained SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of RDV and GS-441524 across the tested variants.

Here we present a comprehensive antiviral activity assessment of RDV and its parent nucleoside, GS-441524, against 10 current and former SARS-CoV-2 VOC/VOI clinical isolates by nucleoprotein ELISA and plaque reduction assay. Delta and Omicron variants remained susceptible to RDV and GS-441524, with EC50 values 0.31 to 0.62-fold of those observed against the ancestral WA1 isolate. All other tested variants exhibited EC50 values ranging from 0.15 to 2.3-fold of the observed EC50 values against WA1. Analysis of nearly 6 million publicly available variant isolate sequences confirmed that Nsp12, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) target of RDV and GS-441524, is highly conserved across variants with only 2 prevalent changes (P323L and G671S). Using recombinant viruses, both RDV and GS-441524 retained potency against all viruses containing frequent variant substitutions or their combination. Taken together, these results highlight the conserved nature of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp12 and provide evidence of sustained SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of RDV and GS-441524 across the tested variants.

To better understand the resistant mechanism, we calculated the binding affinities of 26 antibodies to wild-type (WT) spike protein and to the protein harboring E484K mutation, respectively.

METHOD We reran the Monte Carlo modelling to estimate viral emissions in the fine aerosol size range using available viral load data. We also updated our tool to simulate indoor airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by including a CO2 calculator and recirculating air cleaning devices. We also assessed the consequences of the lower critical dose on the infection risk in public settings with different protection strategies. RESULTS Our modelling suggests that a much larger proportion of individuals infected with the new variants are high, very high or super-emitters of airborne viruses: for the WT, one in 1,000 infected was a super-emitter; for Delta one in 30; and for Omicron one in 20 or one in 10, depending on the viral load estimate used. Testing of the effectiveness of protective strategies in view of the lower critical dose suggests that surgical masks are no longer sufficient in most public settings, while correctly fitted FFP2 respirators still provide sufficient protection, except in high aerosol producing situations such as singing or shouting. DISCUSSION From an aerosol transmission perspective, the shift towards a larger proportion of very high emitting individuals, together with the strongly reduced critical dose, seem to be two important drivers of the aerosol risk, and are likely contributing to the observed rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern.

RESULTS Our modelling suggests that a much larger proportion of individuals infected with the new variants are high, very high or super-emitters of airborne viruses: for the WT, one in 1,000 infected was a super-emitter; for Delta one in 30; and for Omicron one in 20 or one in 10, depending on the viral load estimate used. Testing of the effectiveness of protective strategies in view of the lower critical dose suggests that surgical masks are no longer sufficient in most public settings, while correctly fitted FFP2 respirators still provide sufficient protection, except in high aerosol producing situations such as singing or shouting. DISCUSSION From an aerosol transmission perspective, the shift towards a larger proportion of very high emitting individuals, together with the strongly reduced critical dose, seem to be two important drivers of the aerosol risk, and are likely contributing to the observed rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern.

We aimed to describe the resulting distribution of airborne viral emissions and to reassess the risk estimates for public settings given the higher viral load and infectivity. METHOD We reran the Monte Carlo modelling to estimate viral emissions in the fine aerosol size range using available viral load data. We also updated our tool to simulate indoor airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by including a CO2 calculator and recirculating air cleaning devices. We also assessed the consequences of the lower critical dose on the infection risk in public settings with different protection strategies. RESULTS Our modelling suggests that a much larger proportion of individuals infected with the new variants are high, very high or super-emitters of airborne viruses: for the WT, one in 1,000 infected was a super-emitter; for Delta one in 30; and for Omicron one in 20 or one in 10, depending on the viral load estimate used. Testing of the effectiveness of protective strategies in view of the lower critical dose suggests that surgical masks are no longer sufficient in most public settings, while correctly fitted FFP2 respirators still provide sufficient protection, except in high aerosol producing situations such as singing or shouting. DISCUSSION From an aerosol transmission perspective, the shift towards a larger proportion of very high emitting individuals, together with the strongly reduced critical dose, seem to be two important drivers of the aerosol risk, and are likely contributing to the observed rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern.

We also assessed the consequences of the lower critical dose on the infection risk in public settings with different protection strategies. RESULTS Our modelling suggests that a much larger proportion of individuals infected with the new variants are high, very high or super-emitters of airborne viruses: for the WT, one in 1,000 infected was a super-emitter; for Delta one in 30; and for Omicron one in 20 or one in 10, depending on the viral load estimate used. Testing of the effectiveness of protective strategies in view of the lower critical dose suggests that surgical masks are no longer sufficient in most public settings, while correctly fitted FFP2 respirators still provide sufficient protection, except in high aerosol producing situations such as singing or shouting. DISCUSSION From an aerosol transmission perspective, the shift towards a larger proportion of very high emitting individuals, together with the strongly reduced critical dose, seem to be two important drivers of the aerosol risk, and are likely contributing to the observed rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern.

In the Omicron wave, 8.3% of cases were admitted to hospital (52,038/629,617) compared to 12.9% (71,411/553,530) in the D614G, 12.6% (91,843/726,772) in the Beta and 10.0% (131,083/1,306,260) in the Delta waves (p<0.001). During the Omicron wave, 33.6% of admissions experienced severe disease compared to 52.3%, 63.4% and 63.0% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). The in-hospital case fatality ratio during the Omicron wave was 10.7%, compared to 21.5%, 28.8% and 26.4% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). Compared to the Omicron wave, patients had more severe clinical presentations in the D614G (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.13), Beta (aOR 3.59; CI: 3.49-3.70) and Delta (aOR 3.47: CI: 3.38-3.57) waves.

Patients were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and, if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: alpha (11 March to 3 July 2021), delta (4 July to 25 December 2021), and omicron (26 December 2021 to 14 January 2022). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness calculated using a test negative design for mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 related hospital admissions by each variant (alpha, delta, omicron). Among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, disease severity on the World Health Organization\u2019s clinical progression scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. RESULTS: Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality.

RESULTS: Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality.

Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants.

Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants."}, {"timestamp": "Wed Jun 22 2022 17:46:56 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "training_set_2", "value": "variant", "attribute": "mutation_type", "doi": "10.1016/s0140-6736(22)00327-0", "cord_uid": "jxlvoxi9", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, omicron, appears to be less severe than delta. We aim to quantify the differences in symptom prevalence, risk of hospital admission, and symptom duration among the vaccinated population. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we collected data from participants who were self-reporting test results and symptoms in the ZOE COVID app (previously known as the COVID Symptoms Study App). Eligible participants were aged 16\u201399 years, based in the UK, with a body-mass index between 15 and 55 kg/m(2), had received at least two doses of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, were symptomatic, and logged a positive symptomatic PCR or lateral flow result for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. The primary outcome was the likelihood of developing a given symptom (of the 32 monitored in the app) or hospital admission within 7 days before or after the positive test in participants infected during omicron prevalence compared with those infected during delta prevalence. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2021, and Jan 17, 2022, we identified 63 002 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and reported symptoms in the ZOE app. These patients were matched 1:1 for age, sex, and vaccination dose, across two periods (June 1 to Nov 27, 2021, delta prevalent at >70%; n=4990, and Dec 20, 2021, to Jan 17, 2022, omicron prevalent at >70%; n=4990).

Results: Vaccine effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations included: 85% (95% CI: 82 to 88%) for 2 vaccine doses against Alpha; 85% (95% CI: 83 to 87%) for 2 doses against Delta; 94% (95% CI: 92 to 95%) for 3 doses against Delta; 65% (95% CI: 51 to 75%) for 2 doses against Omicron; and 86% (95% CI: 77 to 91%) for 3 doses against Omicron. Among hospitalized unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, severity on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale was higher for Delta than Alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio [aPOR] 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for Omicron than Delta (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77). Compared to unvaccinated cases, severity was lower for vaccinated cases for each variant, including Alpha (aPOR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.49), Delta (aPOR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.51), and Omicron (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.85). Conclusions: mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations from Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against Omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against Delta and Alpha. Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, Omicron caused less severe disease than Delta, but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants."}, {"timestamp": "Wed Jun 22 2022 18:00:06 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "training_set_2", "value": "lower", "attribute": "level", "doi": "10.1101/2022.02.02.22270222", "cord_uid": "fmv9zy93", "abstract": "Croup is a common upper respiratory disease usually associated with parainfluenza virus, resulting in stridor, hoarse voice, barky cough, and variable respiratory distress. Here we examine the data at our center confirming a sharp increase in cases of croup associated with the Omicron variant. Data was retrospectively extracted from patient charts among those seen in the Emergency Department at Seattle Children's Hospital. Inclusion criteria were patients who were assigned a diagnosis containing \"croup\" during either 5/30/2021-11/30/2021, a time period correlating with predominance of the COVID-19 Delta variant (B.1.617.2), or the initial phase of the Omicron variant surge (12/1/2021-1/15/2022). Contemporaneous publicly available local data on the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 samples in surrounding King County, Washington, with spike gene target failure on TaqPath PCR assays was used as a proxy for the proportion of infections caused by the Omicron variant. A total of 401 patients were diagnosed with croup during the Delta surge and 107 patients were diagnosed with croup during the Omicron surge. Patients who presented during the Omicron surge were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (48.2% vs 2.8%, p < 0.0001). Children with a clinical diagnosis of croup during the Omicron surge were more likely to be prescribed racemic epinephrine as part of their care (21.5% vs 13.0%, p = 0.032). There were no differences in presenting age, rate of admission, rate of return to the ED within 72 hours, or admission among those who returned within 72 hours. During the Omicron surge, the incidence of croup nearly doubled compared to the rate in prior months, while at the same time the number of cases of parainfluenza virus identified decreased. Consistent with prior case reports, we have identified a sharp rise in cases of croup seen in our pediatric ED in parallel with the replacement of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant by Omicron as the dominant variant in our community."}, {"timestamp": "Wed Jun 22 2022 18:00:41 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "training_set_2", "value": "variant", "attribute": "mutation_type", "doi": "10.1136/bmj-2021-069761", "cord_uid": "dlwfu274", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To characterize the clinical severity of covid-19 associated with the alpha, delta, and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants among adults admitted to hospital and to compare the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines to prevent hospital admissions related to each variant.

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 21 hospitals across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 11 690 adults (\u226518 years) admitted to hospital: 5728 with covid-19 (cases) and 5962 without covid-19 (controls). Patients were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and, if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: alpha (11 March to 3 July 2021), delta (4 July to 25 December 2021), and omicron (26 December 2021 to 14 January 2022). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness calculated using a test negative design for mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 related hospital admissions by each variant (alpha, delta, omicron). Among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, disease severity on the World Health Organization\u2019s clinical progression scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. RESULTS: Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants.

This Spike variant is a defining feature of the most prevalent clade (A2a) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes worldwide. Using phylogenomic data, several groups have proposed that the D614G variant may confer increased transmissibility leading to positive selection, while others have claimed that currently available evidence does not support positive selection. Furthermore, in the A2a clade, this mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with a ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on a human codon-optimized spike protein to introduce the D614G variant and produce SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (S-Virus) with this variant and with D614 Spike. We show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that S-Virus carrying the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type S-Virus. This provides functional evidence that the D614G mutation in the Spike protein increases transduction of human cells. Further we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to cleavage in vitro and in human cells, which may suggest a possible mechanism for the increased transduction.

Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). Conclusions mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality.

Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality.

We aimed to investigate, for the two main classes of vaccine, whether efficacy against severe COVID-19 has decreased since delta became the predominant variant and whether the efficacy of two doses of vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes with time since second dose. METHODS: In the REACT-SCOT case-control study, vaccine efficacy was estimated using a matched case-control design that includes all diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Scotland up to Sept 8, 2021. For every incident case of COVID-19 in the Scottish population, ten controls matched for age rounded to the nearest year, sex, and primary care practice, and alive on the day of presentation of the case that they were matched to were selected using the Community Health Index database. To minimise ascertainment bias we prespecified the primary outcome measure to assess vaccine efficacy as severe COVID-19, defined as diagnosed patients with entry to critical care within 21 days of first positive test, death within 28 days of first positive test, or any death for which COVID-19 was coded as underlying cause. Although the data extracted for this study included cases presenting up to Sept 22, 2021, the analyses reported here are restricted to cases and controls presenting from Dec 1, 2020, to Sept 8, 2021, ensuring follow-up for at least 14 days after presentation date to allow classification of hospitalisation and (for most cases) severity based on entry to critical care or fatal outcome. FINDINGS: During the study period, a total of 5645 severe cases of COVID-19 were recorded; these were matched to 50 096 controls. Of the severe cases, 4495 (80%) were not vaccinated, and of the controls, 36 879 (74%) were not vaccinated. Of the severe cases of COVID-19 who had been vaccinated, 389 had received an mRNA vaccine and 759 had received the ChAdOx1 vaccine. The efficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 decreased in May, 2021, coinciding with the replacement of the alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant by the delta variant in Scotland, but this decrease was reversed over the following month. In the most recent time window centred on July 29, 2021, the efficacy of two doses was 91% (95% CI 87\u201394) for the ChAdOx1 vaccine and 92% (88\u201395) for mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) vaccines. The efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 declined with time since second dose to 69% (95% CI 52\u201380) at 20 weeks from second dose. The efficacy of mRNA vaccines declined in the first ten weeks from second dose but more slowly thereafter to 93% (88\u201396) at 20 weeks from second dose. INTERPRETATION: Our results are reassuring with respect to concerns that vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta variant became predominant, or that efficacy of mRNA vaccines wanes within the first 5\u20136 months after second dose. However, the efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes substantially by 20 weeks from second dose. Efficacy of mRNA vaccines after 20 weeks and against newer variants remains to be established. Our findings support the case for additional protective measures for those at risk of severe disease, including, but not limited to, booster doses, at times when transmission rates are high or expected to rise.

We also assessed the consequences of the lower critical dose on the infection risk in public settings with different protection strategies.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur modelling suggests that a much larger proportion of individuals infected with the new variants are high, very high or super-emitters of airborne viruses: for the WT, one in 1,000 infected was a super-emitter; for Delta one in 30; and for Omicron one in 20 or one in 10, depending on the viral load estimate used. Testing of the effectiveness of protective strategies in view of the lower critical dose suggests that surgical masks are no longer sufficient in most public settings, while correctly fitted FFP2 respirators still provide sufficient protection, except in high aerosol producing situations such as singing or shouting.\n\n\nDISCUSSION\nFrom an aerosol transmission perspective, the shift towards a larger proportion of very high emitting individuals, together with the strongly reduced critical dose, seem to be two important drivers of the aerosol risk, and are likely contributing to the observed rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern. Reducing contacts, always wearing well-fitted FFP2 respirators when indoors, using ventilation and other methods to reduce airborne virus concentrations, and avoiding situations with loud voices seem critical to limiting these latest waves of the COVID-19 pandemic."}, {"timestamp": "Wed Jun 29 2022 16:10:41 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "training_set_2", "value": "viral_load", "attribute": "effect", "doi": "10.4414/smw.2022.w30133", "cord_uid": "", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAirborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an important route of infection.

The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants.

In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2."}, {"timestamp": "Thu Jun 30 2022 14:22:00 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "training_set_2", "value": "group", "attribute": "mutation_type", "doi": "10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01058", "cord_uid": "wljvfln0", "abstract": "[Image: see text] The newly emerging Kappa, Delta, and Lambda SARS-CoV-2 variants are worrisome, characterized with the double mutations E484Q/L452R, T478K/L452R, and F490S/L452Q, respectively, in their receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the spike proteins.

Among S variants, the D614G mutant shows the highest cell entry, as supported by structural and binding analyses. Nevertheless, the D614G mutation does not affect neutralization by antisera against prototypic viruses. Taken together, we conclude that the D614G mutation increases cell entry by acquiring higher affinity to ACE2 while maintaining neutralization susceptibility. Based on these findings, further worldwide surveillance is required to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility among humans."}, {"timestamp": "Thu Jun 30 2022 21:07:49 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "training_set_2", "value": "viral_replication", "attribute": "effect", "doi": "10.21203/rs.3.rs-70482/v1", "cord_uid": "2fzsk9gq", "abstract": "A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the infection process, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a crucial role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process by interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. However, new variants of these spike proteins emerge as the virus passes through the disease reservoir. This poses a major challenge for designing a potent antigen for an effective immune response against the spike protein. Through a normal mode analysis (NMA) we identified the highly flexible region in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, starting from residue 475 up to residue 485. Structurally, the position S477 shows the highest flexibility among them. At the same time, S477 is hitherto the most frequently exchanged amino acid residue in the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Therefore, using MD simulations, we have investigated the role of S477 and its two frequent mutations (S477G and S477N) at the RBD during the binding to hACE2. We found that the amino acid exchanges S477G and S477N strengthen the binding of the SARS-COV-2 spike with the hACE2 receptor."}, {"timestamp": "Thu Jun 30 2022 21:42:04 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "training_set_2", "value": "variant", "attribute": "mutation_type", "doi": "10.1101/2021.01.04.425316", "cord_uid": "ole0fpmo", "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an ongoing global pandemic for over a year.

In early January 2021, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and it was shown to have enhanced infectivity in vitro and decreased antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model.

Higher viral replication rates by an infected cell can generate at most one order-of-magnitude rise in viral load, whereas higher cell infectability has minimal impact and lowers the viral load."}, {"timestamp": "Fri Jul 01 2022 12:29:49 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "training_set_2", "value": "B.1.617.2, B.1.351", "attribute": "mutation_name", "doi": "10.1101/2022.01.18.22269300", "cord_uid": "r53waxc7", "abstract": "Recombination is an evolutionary process by which many pathogens generate diversity and acquire novel functions.

The long, complex orf1ab polyproteins of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 play an important role in viral RNA synthesis. To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134 complete protein sequences of orf1ab polyprotein from NCBI Virus database from affected patients across various states of USA from December 2019 to 25(th) April 2020. Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega followed by statistical significance was calculated. Four significant mutations T265I (nsp 2), P4715L (nsp 12) and P5828L and Y5865C (both at nsp 13) were identified in important non\u2010structural proteins, which function either as replicase or helicase.

Several FDA authorized molecular diagnostic tests have been impacted by viral variation, while no reports of viral variation affecting antigen test performance have occurred to date. While determining the analytical sensitivity of the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2), we uncovered a high viral load specimen that repeatedly tested negative by this antigen test. Whole genome sequencing of the specimen uncovered two mutations, T205I and D399N, present in the nucleocapsid protein of the isolate. All six SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens available in our laboratory with a D399N nucleocapsid mutation and C(T) < 31 were not detected by the Sofia 2 but detected by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, while clinical specimens with the T205I mutation were detected by both assays. Testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid with these variants demonstrated an approximate 1000-fold loss in sensitivity for the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test associated with the D399N mutation, while the BinaxNOW and Quidel Quickvue SARS Antigen tests were unaffected by the mutation. The D399N nucleocapsid mutation has been relatively uncommon to date, appearing in only 0.02% of genomes worldwide at time of writing.

We performed rapid antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests simultaneously in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To determine the N protein variations, direct whole-genome sequencing was performed, and the viral assemblies were uploaded to GISAID. We compared their genomes with those of global virus strains from GISAID. These isolates belonged to the B.1.1.7 variant, exhibiting several amino acid substitutions, including D3L, R203K, G204R, and S235F N protein mutations. We also identified the T135I mutation in one variant case in which rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests were discordantly negative and positive, respectively. Our findings suggest that the variants undetected by the PanbioTM COVID-19 rapid antigen test may be due to N-protein T135I mutations, posing a potential diagnostic risk to commercially available antigen tests.

Identification of an RNA packaging sequence was critical for engineered transcripts to assemble together with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) into non-replicative SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) that deliver these transcripts to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells. Using SC2-VLPs, we tested the effect of 30 individual mutations within the S and N proteins on particle assembly and entry. While S mutations unexpectedly did not affect these steps, SC2-VLPs bearing any one of four N mutations found universally in more-transmissible viral variants (P199L, S202R, R203M and R203K) showed increased particle production and up to 10-fold more reporter transcript expression in receiver cells.

This study provides insight into the potential significance of administering RDV to patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 P323L-RdRp mutation, which may have a more favourable chance of alleviating the SARS-CoV-2 illness in comparison to WT-RdRp carriers, thereby suggesting further scientific consensus for the usage of Remdesivir as clinical candidate against COVID-19."}, {"timestamp": "Thu Jul 21 2022 14:27:02 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)", "sessionName": "", "value": "ORF3a_Q213K, N_P13L, N_P13S, N_P13T, N_T362I, N_P365S", "attribute": "mutation_name", "doi": "10.1016/j.isci.2021.103353", "cord_uid": "fh2qg339", "abstract": "We identify amino acid variants within dominant SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes by interrogating global sequence data.

We conducted a study to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with 'S' gene target failure (SGTF, suspected Omicron). Furthermore, their clinical outcomes with COVID-19 patients with non-SGTF (non-Omicron) were also compared. Methods: This study was conducted in Tamil Nadu, India, between December 14, 2021 and January 7, 2022 among patients who underwent reverse transcription-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in four laboratories with facilities for S gene screening. Consecutively selected COVID-19 patients with SGTF were telephonically contacted, 7 and 14 days respectively after their date of positive result to collect information on the socio-demographic characteristics, previous history of COVID-19, vaccination status and clinical course of illness along with treatment details. To compare their outcomes with non-SGTF patients, one randomly suspected non-Omicron case for every two suspected Omicron cases from the line-list were selected, matching for the date of sample collection and the testing laboratory. Results: A total of 1175 SGTF COVID-19 patients were enrolled for this study. Almost 6 per cent (n=72) reported a history of previous infection. 141 (13.5%) suspected Omicron cases were non-vaccinated, while 148 (14.2%) and 703 (67.4%) had received valid one and two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, respectively. Predominant symptoms reported included fever (n=508, 43.2%), body pain (n=275, 23.4%), running nose (n=261, 22.2%) and cough (n=249, 21.2%). Five (0.4%) of the 1175 suspected Omicron cases required oxygen supplementation as compared to ten (1.6%) of the 634 suspected non-Omicron cases. No deaths were reported among omicron suspects, whereas there were four deaths among suspected non-Omicron cases. Interpretation & conclusions: Majority of the suspected Omicron cases had a mild course of illness. The overall severity of these cases was less compared to the suspected non-Omicron cases."}]
