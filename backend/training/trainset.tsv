0	10.1101/2021.05.07.21256341	The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness is not known. Using data from a prospective cohort of index cases and high-risk contact, we reconstructed by modelling the viral load at the time of contact and the probability of infection. The effect of viral load was particularly large in household contacts, with a transmission probability that increased to as much as 37% when the viral load was greater than 10 log 10 copies per mL. The transmission probability peaked at symptom onset in most individuals, with a median probability of transmission of 15%, that hindered large individual variations (IQR: [8, 37]). The model also projects the effects of variants on disease transmission. Based on the current knowledge that viral load is increased by 2 to 4-fold on average, we estimate that infection with B1.1.7 virus could lead to an increase in the probability of transmission by 8 to 17%.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_load | level: higher

2	10.1101/2021.06.10.21258468	Several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) are spreading rapidly in different regions of the world. The underlying mechanisms behind their transmission advantage remain unclear. We measured viral load in 950 individuals and found that infections with variant Alpha exhibit a higher viral load and longer viral shedding compared to non-VOC. We then used a transmission model to analyze the spread of variant Alpha in Geneva, Switzerland, and variant Beta in South Africa. We estimated that Alpha is either associated with a 37% (95% compatibility interval, CI: 25-63%) increase in transmissibility or a 51% (95% CI: 32-80%) increase of the infectious duration, or a combination of the two mechanisms. Assuming 50% immune evasion for Beta, we estimated a 23% (95% CI: 10-37%) increase in transmissibility or a 38% (95% CI: 15-78%) increase of the infectious duration for this variant. Beta is expected to outgrow Alpha in regions where the level of naturally acquired immunity from previously circulating variants exceeds 20% to 40%. Close monitoring of Alpha and Beta in regions with different levels of immunity will help to anticipate the global spread of these and future variants.	mutation_name: ALPHA | effect: viral_load | level: higher

6	10.4414/smw.2022.w30133	BACKGROUND Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an important route of infection. For the wildtype (WT) only a small proportion of those infected emitted large quantities of the virus. The currently prevalent variants of concern, Delta (B1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529), are characterized by higher viral loads and a lower minimal infective dose compared to the WT. We aimed to describe the resulting distribution of airborne viral emissions and to reassess the risk estimates for public settings given the higher viral load and infectivity. METHOD We reran the Monte Carlo modelling to estimate viral emissions in the fine aerosol size range using available viral load data. We also updated our tool to simulate indoor airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by including a CO2 calculator and recirculating air cleaning devices. We also assessed the consequences of the lower critical dose on the infection risk in public settings with different protection strategies. RESULTS Our modelling suggests that a much larger proportion of individuals infected with the new variants are high, very high or super-emitters of airborne viruses: for the WT, one in 1,000 infected was a super-emitter; for Delta one in 30; and for Omicron one in 20 or one in 10, depending on the viral load estimate used. Testing of the effectiveness of protective strategies in view of the lower critical dose suggests that surgical masks are no longer sufficient in most public settings, while correctly fitted FFP2 respirators still provide sufficient protection, except in high aerosol producing situations such as singing or shouting. DISCUSSION From an aerosol transmission perspective, the shift towards a larger proportion of very high emitting individuals, together with the strongly reduced critical dose, seem to be two important drivers of the aerosol risk, and are likely contributing to the observed rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern. Reducing contacts, always wearing well-fitted FFP2 respirators when indoors, using ventilation and other methods to reduce airborne virus concentrations, and avoiding situations with loud voices seem critical to limiting these latest waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

9	10.1002/jmv.20707	SARS‐CoV is a newly identified coronavirus (CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important structural and functional protein. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the SARS‐CoV N protein and to elucidate the possible involvement of N protein in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis, a human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two‐hybrid system assay. hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of sumoylation system, was found to interact specifically with the N protein, implying the post‐translational sumoylation of the N protein. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170–210, which includes the SR‐rich motif. However, the consensus motif of sumoylation GK(62)EE in the N protein is not responsible for binding to hUbc9. Mutations of hUbc9 at the enzyme active site C93A or C93S severely impair the interaction with the N protein. The two proteins were also shown to colocalize in the cytoplasm of the transfected 293T cells. This is the first report demonstrating the interaction of hUbc9 with a structural protein of plus‐strand RNA viruses, indicating a new drug target for SARS‐CoV. J. Med.

10	10.3389/fimmu.2021.720205	Patients with the monogenic immune dysregulatory syndrome autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, uniformly carry neutralizing autoantibodies directed against type-I interferons (IFNs) and many develop autoimmune pneumonitis, both of which place them at high risk for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and block entry of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. The use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab early during infection was associated with reduced COVID-19–associated hospitalization and death in patients at high risk for progressing to severe disease, which led the US Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for their administration in non-hypoxemic, non-hospitalized high-risk patients. However, the safety and efficacy of these mAbs has not been evaluated in APECED patients. We enrolled two siblings with APECED on an IRB-approved protocol (NCT01386437) and admitted them prophylactically at the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We assessed the safety and clinical effects of early treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. The administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab was well tolerated and was associated with amelioration of COVID-19 symptoms and prevention of invasive ventilatory support, admission to the intensive care, and death in both patients without affecting the production of antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. If given early in the course of COVID-19 infection, bamlanivimab and etesevimab may be beneficial in APECED and other high-risk patients with neutralizing autoantibodies directed against type-I IFNs.	mutation_name:  | effect:  | level:

14	10.1101/2022.02.22.21268475	Background: Clinical severity of patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron (fourth) wave was assessed and compared to trends in the D614G (first), Beta (second), and Delta (third) waves in South Africa. Methods: Weekly incidence of 30 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases/100,000 population defined the start and end of each wave. Hospital admission data were collected through an active national COVID-19-specific surveillance programme. Disease severity was compared across waves by post-imputation random effect multivariable logistic regression models. Severe disease was defined as one or more of acute respiratory distress, supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, intensive-care admission or death. Results: 335,219 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admissions were analysed, constituting 10.4% of 3,216,179 cases recorded during the 4 waves. In the Omicron wave, 8.3% of cases were admitted to hospital (52,038/629,617) compared to 12.9% (71,411/553,530) in the D614G, 12.6% (91,843/726,772) in the Beta and 10.0% (131,083/1,306,260) in the Delta waves (p<0.001). During the Omicron wave, 33.6% of admissions experienced severe disease compared to 52.3%, 63.4% and 63.0% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). The in-hospital case fatality ratio during the Omicron wave was 10.7%, compared to 21.5%, 28.8% and 26.4% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). Compared to the Omicron wave, patients had more severe clinical presentations in the D614G (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.13), Beta (aOR 3.59; CI: 3.49-3.70) and Delta (aOR 3.47: CI: 3.38-3.57) waves. Conclusion: The trend of increasing cases and admissions across South Africa's first three waves shifted in Omicron fourth wave, with a higher and quicker peak but fewer admitted patients, who experienced less clinically severe illness and had a lower case-fatality ratio. Omicron marked a change in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve, clinical profile and deaths in South Africa. Extrapolations to other populations should factor in differing vaccination and prior infection levels.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect: disease_severity | level: lower

Conclusion: The trend of increasing cases and admissions across South Africa's first three waves shifted in Omicron fourth wave, with a higher and quicker peak but fewer admitted patients, who experienced less clinically severe illness and had a lower case-fatality ratio. Omicron marked a change in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve, clinical profile and deaths in South Africa.

16	10.1101/2022.02.22.21268475	Background: Clinical severity of patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron (fourth) wave was assessed and compared to trends in the D614G (first), Beta (second), and Delta (third) waves in South Africa. Methods: Weekly incidence of 30 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases/100,000 population defined the start and end of each wave. Hospital admission data were collected through an active national COVID-19-specific surveillance programme. Disease severity was compared across waves by post-imputation random effect multivariable logistic regression models. Severe disease was defined as one or more of acute respiratory distress, supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, intensive-care admission or death. Results: 335,219 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admissions were analysed, constituting 10.4% of 3,216,179 cases recorded during the 4 waves. In the Omicron wave, 8.3% of cases were admitted to hospital (52,038/629,617) compared to 12.9% (71,411/553,530) in the D614G, 12.6% (91,843/726,772) in the Beta and 10.0% (131,083/1,306,260) in the Delta waves (p<0.001). During the Omicron wave, 33.6% of admissions experienced severe disease compared to 52.3%, 63.4% and 63.0% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001).

18	10.7326/m22-0308	BACKGROUND: At the end of 2021, the B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 variant (Omicron) wave superseded the B.1.617.2 variant (Delta) wave. OBJECTIVE: To compare baseline characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Delta variant versus the Omicron variant in the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: Retrospective chart reviews. SETTING: 13 adult EDs in academic hospitals in the Paris area from 29 November 2021 to 10 January 2022. PATIENTS: Patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2 and variant identification. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome measures were baseline clinical and biological characteristics at ED presentation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3728 patients had a positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period; 1716 patients who had a variant determination (818 Delta and 898 Omicron) were included. Median age was 58 years, and 49% were women. Patients infected with the Omicron variant were younger (54 vs. 62 years; difference, 8.0 years [95% CI, 4.6 to 11.4 years]), had a lower rate of obesity (8.0% vs. 12.5%; difference, 4.5 percentage points [CI, 1.5 to 7.5 percentage points]), were more vaccinated (65% vs. 39% for 1 dose and 22% vs. 11% for 3 doses), had a lower rate of dyspnea (26% vs. 50%; difference, 23.6 percentage points [CI, 19.0 to 28.2 percentage points]), and had a higher rate of discharge home from the ED (59% vs. 37%; difference, 21.9 percentage points [−26.5 to −17.1 percentage points]). Compared with Delta, Omicron infection was independently associated with a lower risk for ICU admission (adjusted difference, 11.4 percentage points [CI, 8.4 to 14.4 percentage points]), mechanical ventilation (adjusted difference, 3.6 percentage points [CI, 1.7 to 5.6 percentage points]), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted difference, 4.2 percentage points [CI, 2.0 to 6.5 percentage points]). LIMITATION: Patients with COVID-19 illness and no SARS-CoV-2 variant determination in the ED were excluded. CONCLUSION: Compared with the Delta variant, infection with the Omicron variant in patients in the ED had different clinical and biological patterns and was associated with better in-hospital outcomes, including higher survival.

20	10.1136/bmj-2021-069761	OBJECTIVES: To characterize the clinical severity of covid-19 associated with the alpha, delta, and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants among adults admitted to hospital and to compare the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines to prevent hospital admissions related to each variant. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 21 hospitals across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 11 690 adults (≥18 years) admitted to hospital: 5728 with covid-19 (cases) and 5962 without covid-19 (controls). Patients were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and, if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: alpha (11 March to 3 July 2021), delta (4 July to 25 December 2021), and omicron (26 December 2021 to 14 January 2022). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness calculated using a test negative design for mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 related hospital admissions by each variant (alpha, delta, omicron). Among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, disease severity on the World Health Organization’s clinical progression scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. RESULTS: Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect: disease_severity | level: lower

RESULTS: Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect: fatality_rate | level: no evidence
24	10.1016/s0140-6736(22)00327-0	BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, omicron, appears to be less severe than delta. We aim to quantify the differences in symptom prevalence, risk of hospital admission, and symptom duration among the vaccinated population. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we collected data from participants who were self-reporting test results and symptoms in the ZOE COVID app (previously known as the COVID Symptoms Study App). Eligible participants were aged 16–99 years, based in the UK, with a body-mass index between 15 and 55 kg/m(2), had received at least two doses of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, were symptomatic, and logged a positive symptomatic PCR or lateral flow result for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. The primary outcome was the likelihood of developing a given symptom (of the 32 monitored in the app) or hospital admission within 7 days before or after the positive test in participants infected during omicron prevalence compared with those infected during delta prevalence. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2021, and Jan 17, 2022, we identified 63 002 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and reported symptoms in the ZOE app. These patients were matched 1:1 for age, sex, and vaccination dose, across two periods (June 1 to Nov 27, 2021, delta prevalent at >70%; n=4990, and Dec 20, 2021, to Jan 17, 2022, omicron prevalent at >70%; n=4990). Loss of smell was less common in participants infected during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (16·7% vs 52·7%, odds ratio [OR] 0·17; 95% CI 0·16–0·19, p<0·001). Sore throat was more common during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (70·5% vs 60·8%, 1·55; 1·43–1·69, p<0·001). There was a lower rate of hospital admission during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (1·9% vs 2·6%, OR 0·75; 95% CI 0·57–0·98, p=0·03). INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of symptoms that characterise an omicron infection differs from those of the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant, apparently with less involvement of the lower respiratory tract and reduced probability of hospital admission. Our data indicate a shorter period of illness and potentially of infectiousness which should impact work–health policies and public health advice.

30	10.1248/bpb.b21-01081	A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain, the Omicron variant (Pango lineage B.1.1.529), was identified in South Africa in late September 2021. This variant has multiple spike protein deletions and mutations, with 15 amino acid substitutions detected in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These RBD substitutions are hypothesized to increase infectivity and reduce antibody affinity, which is supported by recent data showing that the Omicron variant spreads faster than the Delta variant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2). Thus, this increase in infectivity should lead to Omicron being the dominant variant and developing screening tests that discriminate between Omicron and Delta variants is urgently needed. In this study, we successfully developed a novel screening assay using high-resolution melting analysis, in which two genotypes at G446/L452 and S477/T478 RBD were determined (G446S/L452 and S477N/T478K for Omicron; G446/L452R and S477/T478K for Delta). Using synthetic DNA fragments, we confirmed both melting point and melting peak shape of the RBD Omicron variant was distinguishable from those of wild-type and the Delta variant. Although this study was conducted without clinical samples, these results suggest that our HRM-based genotyping method can readily identify the Omicron and Delta variants. This simple method should contribute to the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants and thus prevent potential widespread infection and inflow of the Omicron variant.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect: infectivity | level: higher

Using synthetic DNA fragments, we confirmed both melting point and melting peak shape of the RBD Omicron variant was distinguishable from those of wild-type and the Delta variant. Although this study was conducted without clinical samples, these results suggest that our HRM-based genotyping method can readily identify the Omicron and Delta variants. This simple method should contribute to the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants and thus prevent potential widespread infection and inflow of the Omicron variant.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics | level: unaffected
34	10.1248/bpb.b21-01081	A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain, the Omicron variant (Pango lineage B.1.1.529), was identified in South Africa in late September 2021. This variant has multiple spike protein deletions and mutations, with 15 amino acid substitutions detected in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These RBD substitutions are hypothesized to increase infectivity and reduce antibody affinity, which is supported by recent data showing that the Omicron variant spreads faster than the Delta variant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2). Thus, this increase in infectivity should lead to Omicron being the dominant variant and developing screening tests that discriminate between Omicron and Delta variants is urgently needed. In this study, we successfully developed a novel screening assay using high-resolution melting analysis, in which two genotypes at G446/L452 and S477/T478 RBD were determined (G446S/L452 and S477N/T478K for Omicron; G446/L452R and S477/T478K for Delta).

35	10.1101/2021.12.27.474273	The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become the dominant infective strain and the focus efforts against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here we report an extensive set of structures of the Omicron spike trimer by its own or in complex with ACE2 and an anti-Omicron antibody. These structures reveal that most Omicron mutations are located on the surface of the spike protein, which confer stronger ACE2 binding by nearly 10 folds but become inactive epitopes resistant to many therapeutic antibodies. Importantly, both RBD and the closed conformation of the Omicron spike trimer are thermodynamically unstable, with the melting temperature of the Omicron RBD decreased by as much as 7°C, making the spiker trimer prone to random open conformations. An unusual RBD-RBD interaction in the ACE2-spike complex unique to Omicron is observed to support the open conformation and ACE2 binding, serving the basis for the higher infectivity of Omicron. A broad-spectrum therapeutic antibody JMB2002, which has completed Phase 1 clinical trial, is found to interact with the same two RBDs to inhibit ACE2 binding, in a mode that is distinguished from all previous antibodies, thus providing the structural basis for the potent inhibition of Omicron by this antibody. Together with biochemical data, our structures provide crucial insights into higher infectivity, antibody evasion and inhibition of Omicron.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

However, whether the increasing prevalence of the S-614G variant represents a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains elusive. Here, we generated isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate that the S-614G variant has (i) enhanced binding to human host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), (ii) increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a novel human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and (iii) markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data show that while the S-614G substitution results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro, it provides a real competitive advantage in vivo, particularly during the transmission bottle neck, providing an explanation for the global predominance of S-614G variant among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently circulating.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

45	10.1101/2020.06.14.151357	A novel isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the D614G variant and show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type. We demonstrate increased infection using both Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and intact SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction. This result has important implications for the efficacy of Spike-based vaccines currently under development in protecting against this recent and highly-prevalent SARS-CoV-2 isolate.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect: infectivity | level: higher

48	10.1002/prot.26042	The human spike protein sequences from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania were analyzed by comparing with the reference severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) protein sequence from Wuhan‐Hu‐1, China. Out of 10333 spike protein sequences analyzed, 8155 proteins comprised one or more mutations. A total of 9654 mutations were observed that correspond to 400 distinct mutation sites. The receptor binding domain (RBD) which is involved in the interactions with human angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE‐2) receptor and causes infection leading to the COVID‐19 disease comprised 44 mutations that included residues within 3.2 Å interacting distance from the ACE‐2 receptor. The mutations observed in the spike proteins are discussed in the context of their distribution according to the geographical locations, mutation sites, mutation types, distribution of the number of mutations at the mutation sites and mutations at the glycosylation sites. The density of mutations in different regions of the spike protein sequence and location of the mutations in protein three‐dimensional structure corresponding to the RBD are discussed. The mutations identified in the present work are important considerations for antibody, vaccine, and drug development.	mutation_name:  | effect:  | level:

Here we analysed the impact of these mutations on vaccination- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells. We confirmed that, in the majority of infected or vaccinated individuals, different mutations present in a single VOC (Delta) or a combined mosaic of more than 30 AA substitutions and deletions found in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron VOCs cause modest alteration in the global Spike-specific T cell response. However, distinct numerically dominant Spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells preferentially targeted regions affected by AA mutations and do not recognise the mutated peptides. Importantly, some of these mutations, such as N501Y (present in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron) and L452R (present in Delta), known to provide biological advantage to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of infectivity also abolished CD8 T cell recognition.

Importantly, some of these mutations, such as N501Y (present in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron) and L452R (present in Delta), known to provide biological advantage to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of infectivity also abolished CD8 T cell recognition. Taken together, our data show that while global mRNA vaccine- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells largely tolerate the diverse mutations present in VOCs, single Spike-specific T cells might contribute to the natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 variants.	mutation_name: SPIKE_L452R | effect: immune_escape | level: higher
52	10.1016/j.isci.2021.102257	Viruses interact extensively with the host molecular machinery, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Bacteriophage T7 recruits the small protein thioredoxin of the Escherichia coli host as an essential processivity factor for the viral DNA polymerase. We challenged the phage to propagate in a host in which thioredoxin had been extensively modified to hamper its recruitment. The virus adapted to the engineered host without losing the capability to propagate in the original host, but no genetic mutations were fixed in the thioredoxin binding domain of the viral DNA polymerase. Virus adaptation correlated with mutations in the viral RNA polymerase, supporting that promiscuous thioredoxin recruitment was enabled by phenotypic mutations caused by transcription errors. These results point to a mechanism of virus adaptation that may play a role in cross-species transmission. We propose that phenotypic mutations may generally contribute to the capability of viruses to evade antiviral strategies.	mutation_name:  | effect:  | level:

57	10.1016/s2213-2600(22)00045-5	BACKGROUND: Reports have suggested that the efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant replaced the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant as the predominant variant. We aimed to investigate, for the two main classes of vaccine, whether efficacy against severe COVID-19 has decreased since delta became the predominant variant and whether the efficacy of two doses of vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes with time since second dose. METHODS: In the REACT-SCOT case-control study, vaccine efficacy was estimated using a matched case-control design that includes all diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Scotland up to Sept 8, 2021. For every incident case of COVID-19 in the Scottish population, ten controls matched for age rounded to the nearest year, sex, and primary care practice, and alive on the day of presentation of the case that they were matched to were selected using the Community Health Index database. To minimise ascertainment bias we prespecified the primary outcome measure to assess vaccine efficacy as severe COVID-19, defined as diagnosed patients with entry to critical care within 21 days of first positive test, death within 28 days of first positive test, or any death for which COVID-19 was coded as underlying cause. Although the data extracted for this study included cases presenting up to Sept 22, 2021, the analyses reported here are restricted to cases and controls presenting from Dec 1, 2020, to Sept 8, 2021, ensuring follow-up for at least 14 days after presentation date to allow classification of hospitalisation and (for most cases) severity based on entry to critical care or fatal outcome. FINDINGS: During the study period, a total of 5645 severe cases of COVID-19 were recorded; these were matched to 50 096 controls. Of the severe cases, 4495 (80%) were not vaccinated, and of the controls, 36 879 (74%) were not vaccinated. Of the severe cases of COVID-19 who had been vaccinated, 389 had received an mRNA vaccine and 759 had received the ChAdOx1 vaccine. The efficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 decreased in May, 2021, coinciding with the replacement of the alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant by the delta variant in Scotland, but this decrease was reversed over the following month. In the most recent time window centred on July 29, 2021, the efficacy of two doses was 91% (95% CI 87–94) for the ChAdOx1 vaccine and 92% (88–95) for mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) vaccines. The efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 declined with time since second dose to 69% (95% CI 52–80) at 20 weeks from second dose. The efficacy of mRNA vaccines declined in the first ten weeks from second dose but more slowly thereafter to 93% (88–96) at 20 weeks from second dose. INTERPRETATION: Our results are reassuring with respect to concerns that vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta variant became predominant, or that efficacy of mRNA vaccines wanes within the first 5–6 months after second dose. However, the efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes substantially by 20 weeks from second dose. Efficacy of mRNA vaccines after 20 weeks and against newer variants remains to be established. Our findings support the case for additional protective measures for those at risk of severe disease, including, but not limited to, booster doses, at times when transmission rates are high or expected to rise.

58	10.1038/s41564-021-01047-y	The major transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 is airborne. However, previous studies could not elucidate the contribution between large droplets and aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Here, we designed and validated an optimized transmission caging setup, which allows for the assessment of aerosol transmission efficiency at various distances. At a distance of 2 m, only particles of <5 µm traversed between cages. Using this setup, we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission between the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and lineage A in Syrian hamsters. Aerosol transmission of both variants was confirmed in all sentinels after 24 h of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory virus shedding and seroconversion. Productive transmission also occurred after 1 h of exposure, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, after donors were infected with a mix of both variants, the Alpha variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain. Overall, these data indicate that a lower infectious dose of the Alpha variant, compared to lineage A, could be sufficient for successful transmission. This highlights the continuous need to assess emerging variants and the development for pre-emptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

60	10.1007/978-3-030-86582-5_1	COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Although a number of new vaccines are available to combat this threat, a high prevalence of novel mutant viral variants is observed in all world regions affected by this infection. Among viral proteomes, the highly glycosylated spike protein (Sprot) of SARS-CoV-2 has received the most attention due to its interaction with the host receptor ACE2. To understand the mechanisms of viral variant infectivity and the interaction of the RBD of Sprot with the host ACE2, we performed a large-scale mutagenesis study of the RBD-ACE2 interface by performing 1780 point mutations in silico and identifying the ambiguous stabilisation of the interface by the most common point mutations described in the literature. Furthermore, we pinpointed the N501Y mutation at the RBD of Sprot as profoundly affecting complex formation and confirmed greater stability of the N501Y mutant compared to wild-type (WT) viral S protein by molecular dynamics experiments. These findings could be important for the study and design of upcoming vaccines, PPI inhibitor molecules, and therapeutic antibodies or antibody mimics. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N501Y | effect: protein_stability | level: higher

67	10.3390/ijms22179131	The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in December 2019 has caused a global pandemic. The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484Q | effect: intermolecular_interactions | level: higher

This study describes a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from a 53-year-old woman from Apulia (Italy), who was COVID-19 positive for approximately four months. In this paper we aimed to investigate any potential correlation between genetic mutations and clinical features of this case of infection. The viral isolate was assigned to lineage B.1.177.51 through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and harbored a novel set of mutations on the Spike protein (V143D, del144/145 and E484K); furthermore, seroneutralization assays showed impaired response of the surveyed strain to BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine-induced (average reduction of 70%) and convalescent sera (average reduction of 19.04%), when compared to VOC P.1. This study highlights the importance of genomic surveillance for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevance of monitoring of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations in all lineages, and the necessity of testing the response of emerging variants to available therapies and vaccines.	mutation_name: B.1.177.51 | effect: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera | level: lower

86	10.1016/j.cmi.2021.05.022	BACKGROUND: Many new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been termed Variants of Concern/Interest (VOC/I) because of their greater risk due to possibly: enhanced transmissibility and/or severity, immune escape, diagnostic and/or treatment failure, and reduced vaccine efficacy. OBJECTIVES: We sought to review current knowledge of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those deemed VOC/Is: B.1.351, B.1.1.7, and P.1. SOURCES: MEDLINE and BioRxiv databases, as well as the grey literature were searched for reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants since November 2020. Relevant articles and their references were screened. CONTENT: Mutations on the spike protein in particular may affect both affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor ACEII or antibody binding. These VOC/Is often share similar mutation sets. The N501Y mutation is shared by the main three VOCs: B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom; P.1, originating from Brazil; and B.1.351, first described in South Africa. This mutation likely increases transmissibility, by increasing affinity for ACEII. The B.1.351 and P.1 variants also display the E484K mutation, which decreases binding of neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, favoring reinfections, and decreased in vitro efficacy of some antibody therapies or vaccines. Those mutations may also have phenotypical repercussions of higher severity. Furthermore, the accumulation of mutations poses a diagnostic risk (lowered when using multiplex assays), as seen for some assays targeting the S-gene. With ongoing surveillance, many new VOC/Is have been identified. The emergence of the E484K mutation independently in different parts of the globe may reflect adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans in a background of increasing immunity. IMPLICATIONS: These VOC/Is are increasing in frequency globally and pose challenges to any herd immunity approach of managing the pandemic. While vaccination is ongoing, vaccine updates may be prudent. The virus continues to adapt to transmission in humans, and further divergence from the initial Wuhan sequences is expected.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N501Y | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

The B.1.351 and P.1 variants also display the E484K mutation, which decreases binding of neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, favoring reinfections, and decreased in vitro efficacy of some antibody therapies or vaccines. Those mutations may also have phenotypical repercussions of higher severity. Furthermore, the accumulation of mutations poses a diagnostic risk (lowered when using multiplex assays), as seen for some assays targeting the S-gene. With ongoing surveillance, many new VOC/Is have been identified. The emergence of the E484K mutation independently in different parts of the globe may reflect adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans in a background of increasing immunity. IMPLICATIONS: These VOC/Is are increasing in frequency globally and pose challenges to any herd immunity approach of managing the pandemic. While vaccination is ongoing, vaccine updates may be prudent. The virus continues to adapt to transmission in humans, and further divergence from the initial Wuhan sequences is expected.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect: binding_to_antibodies | level: lower

The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020, the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October 2020, more than 40% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P.1, P.2 and B.1.1.33 - posteriorly renamed as N.9) in four Brazilian regions.

98	10.26355/eurrev_202112_27653	Recently a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from South Africa. World Health Organization (WHO) named this mutant as a variant of concern - Omicron (B.1.1.529) on 26th November 2021. This variant exhibited more than thirty amino acid mutations in the spike protein. This mutation rate is exceeding the other variants by approximately 5-11 times in the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein. Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant might have enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. This new variant can reinfect individuals previously infected with other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Scientists expressed their concern about the efficacy of already existing COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron (B.1.1.529) infections. Some of the crucial mutations that are detected in the receptor-binding domain of the Omicron variant have been shared by previously evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on the Omicron mutation profile in the receptor-binding domain and motif, it might have collectively enhanced or intermediary infectivity relative to its previous variants.

113	10.1016/j.chom.2020.11.012	The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the pandemic that confers greater infectivity and is now the globally dominant form. To determine whether D614G might also mediate neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 spike.

Such mutations can occur in the spike (S) protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor and is cleaved by TMPRSS2. However, whether S mutations affect SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remains unknown. Here, we show that naturally occurring S mutations can reduce or enhance cell entry via ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus exhibits substantially lower entry than that of SARS-CoV S. Among S variants, the D614G mutant shows the highest cell entry, as supported by structural and binding analyses. Nevertheless, the D614G mutation does not affect neutralization by antisera against prototypic viruses. Taken together, we conclude that the D614G mutation increases cell entry by acquiring higher affinity to ACE2 while maintaining neutralization susceptibility.

Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an “up” conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines | level: unaffected

128	10.1038/s41598-021-83761-5	Since the worldwide outbreak of the infectious disease COVID-19, several studies have been published to understand the structural mechanism of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. During the infection process, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a crucial role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process by interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. However, new variants of these spike proteins emerge as the virus passes through the disease reservoir. This poses a major challenge for designing a potent antigen for an effective immune response against the spike protein. Through a normal mode analysis (NMA) we identified the highly flexible region in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, starting from residue 475 up to residue 485. Structurally, the position S477 shows the highest flexibility among them. At the same time, S477 is hitherto the most frequently exchanged amino acid residue in the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Therefore, using MD simulations, we have investigated the role of S477 and its two frequent mutations (S477G and S477N) at the RBD during the binding to hACE2. We found that the amino acid exchanges S477G and S477N strengthen the binding of the SARS-COV-2 spike with the hACE2 receptor.	mutation_name: SPIKE_S477G | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

From genome analysis, the N501Y mutation within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein might have enhanced the viral protein’s binding with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The latter is the prelude for the virus’ entry into host cells. So far, the molecular mechanism of this enhanced binding is still elusive, which prevents us from assessing its effects on existing therapeutic antibodies. Using all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that Y501 in mutated RBD can be well coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, increasing the overall binding affinity between RBD and hACE2 by about 0.81 kcal/mol. We further explored how the N501Y mutation might affect the binding between a neutralizing antibody (CB6) and RBD. We expect that our work can help researchers design proper measures responding to this urgent virus mutation, such as adding a modified/new neutralizing antibody specifically targeting at this variant in the therapeutic antibody cocktail.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N501Y | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

Recently detected Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.529) is heavily mutated on RBD. Currently, the most common Omicron variants are the original BA.1 Omicron strain and the BA.2 variant, which became more prevalent since it first appeared. To investigate how these mutations affect RBD-PD interactions, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the BA.1 and BA.2 RBD-PD in the presence of full-length glycans, explicit water and ions. Simulations revealed that RBDs of BA.1 and BA.2 variants exhibit a more dispersed interaction network and make an increased number of salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions with PD compared to wild-type RBD. Although BA.1 and BA.2 differ in two residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface, no major difference in RBD-PD interactions and binding strengths were observed between these variants. Using the conformations sampled in each trajectory, the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method estimated ~34% and ~51% stronger binding free energies for BA.1 and BA.2 RBD, respectively, than wild-type RBD, which may result in higher binding efficiency of the Omicron variant to infect host cells.	mutation_name: BA.1 | effect: protein_conformational_optimization | level: higher

To investigate how these mutations affect RBD-PD interactions, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the BA.1 and BA.2 RBD-PD in the presence of full-length glycans, explicit water and ions. Simulations revealed that RBDs of BA.1 and BA.2 variants exhibit a more dispersed interaction network and make an increased number of salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions with PD compared to wild-type RBD. Although BA.1 and BA.2 differ in two residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface, no major difference in RBD-PD interactions and binding strengths were observed between these variants. Using the conformations sampled in each trajectory, the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method estimated ~34% and ~51% stronger binding free energies for BA.1 and BA.2 RBD, respectively, than wild-type RBD, which may result in higher binding efficiency of the Omicron variant to infect host cells.	mutation_name: BA.2 | effect: protein_conformational_optimization | level: higher

138	10.1126/science.abf4058	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins interact with the eukaryotic translation machinery, and inhibitors of translation have potent antiviral effects. We found that the drug plitidepsin (aplidin), which has limited clinical approval, possesses antiviral activity (90% inhibitory concentration = 0.88 nM) that is more potent than remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by a factor of 27.5, with limited toxicity in cell culture. Through the use of a drug-resistant mutant, we show that the antiviral activity of plitidepsin against SARS-CoV-2 is mediated through inhibition of the known target eEF1A (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A). We demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of plitidepsin treatment in two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a reduction of viral replication in the lungs by two orders of magnitude using prophylactic treatment. Our results indicate that plitidepsin is a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.	mutation_name:  | effect:  | level:

As animal models and traditional in vitro systems may fail to model key aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, representative in vitro systems to assess variants phenotypically are urgently needed. We found that the British variant (clade B.1.1.7), compared to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 clade B virus, produced higher levels of infectious virus late in infection and had a higher replicative fitness in human airway, alveolar and intestinal organoid models. Our findings unveil human organoids as powerful tools to phenotype viral variants and suggest extended shedding as a correlate of fitness for SARS-CoV-2. One-Sentence Summary British SARS-CoV-2 variant (clade B.1.1.7) infects organoids for extended time and has a higher fitness in vitro.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_fitness | level: higher

141	10.1371/journal.ppat.1009914	As novel SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, it is critical that their potential to cause severe disease and evade vaccine-induced immunity is rapidly assessed in humans and studied in animal models. In early January 2021, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and it was shown to have enhanced infectivity in vitro and decreased antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both variants exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1 (614G), with B.1.429 causing the most marked body weight loss among the 3 variants. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1. (614G) and B.1.427 infections. In addition, subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA) levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429, however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three variants. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1 (614G) or B.1.427 in the oropharynx but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments, we found that B.1. (614G), epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) and gamma (P.1) dramatically outcompete alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) and zeta (P.2) in the lungs. In the nasal cavity, B.1. (614G), gamma, and epsilon dominate, but the highly infectious alpha variant also maintains a moderate size niche. We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427, B.1.429 and ancestral B.1 (614G) and WA-1 variants in hamsters. These results demonstrate enhanced virulence and high relative oropharyngeal replication of the epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) variant in Syrian hamsters compared to an ancestral B.1 (614G) variant.	mutation_name: B.1.429 | effect: infectivity | level: higher

148	10.1371/journal.ppat.1009914	As novel SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, it is critical that their potential to cause severe disease and evade vaccine-induced immunity is rapidly assessed in humans and studied in animal models. In early January 2021, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and it was shown to have enhanced infectivity in vitro and decreased antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both variants exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1 (614G), with B.1.429 causing the most marked body weight loss among the 3 variants. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1. (614G) and B.1.427 infections. In addition, subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA) levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429, however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three variants. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1 (614G) or B.1.427 in the oropharynx but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments, we found that B.1. (614G), epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) and gamma (P.1) dramatically outcompete alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) and zeta (P.2) in the lungs. In the nasal cavity, B.1.

150	10.1111/1751-7915.14064	Summary The Omicron variant rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain in South Africa and elsewhere. This review explores whether this rise was due to an increased transmission of the variant or its escape from population immunity by an extensively mutated spike protein. The mutations affected the structure of the spike protein leading to the loss of neutralization by most, but not all, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Omicron also shows substantial immune escape from serum antibodies in convalescent patients and vaccinees. A booster immunization increased, however, the titre and breadth of antiviral antibody response. The cellular immune response against Omicron was largely preserved explaining a satisfying protection of boosted vaccinees against severe infections. Clinicians observed less severe infection with Omicron, but other scientists warned that this must not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed a lesser virulence than previous VOCs and lung functions were less compromised. Cell biologists demonstrated that Omicron differs from Delta by preferring the endocytic pathway for cell entry over fusion with the plasma membrane which might explain Omicron?s distinct replication along the respiratory tract compared with Delta. Omicron represents a distinct evolutionary lineage that deviated from the mainstream of evolving SARS-CoV-2 already in mid-2020 raising questions about where it circulated before getting widespread in December 2021. The role of Omicron for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: lower

157	10.1128/jvi.00203-08	Sequencing and reversion analysis of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) temperature-sensitive (ts) viruses has identified putative ts mutations in the replicase nonstructural proteins (nsp's) of these coronaviruses. In this study, reverse transcriptase PCR sequencing of the RNA genome of an isolate of the MHV ts virus Alb ts6, referred to as Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A, identified a putative ts mutation in nsp5 (T10651C, Val148Ala), the viral 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro). The introduction of the T10651C mutation into the infectious MHV clone resulted in the recovery of a mutant virus, the nsp5/V148A virus, that demonstrated reduced growth and nsp5 proteinase activity identical to that of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A at the nonpermissive temperature. Sequence analysis of 40 degrees C revertants of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A identified primary reversion to Ala148Val in nsp5, as well as two independent second-site mutations resulting in Ser133Asn and His134Tyr substitutions in nsp5. The introduction of the Ser133Asn or His134Tyr substitution into the cloned nsp5/V148A mutant virus background resulted in the recovery of viruses with increased growth fitness and the partial restoration of nsp5 activity at the nonpermissive temperature. Modeling of the nsp5 structure of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A predicted that the Val148Ala mutation alters residue 148 interactions with residues of the substrate binding S1 subsite of the nsp5 active-site cavity. This study identifies novel residues in nsp5 that may be important for regulating substrate specificity and nsp5 proteinase activity.	mutation_name:  | effect:  | level:

These primer-probe sets were also successfully employed on wastewater samples aimed at detecting and even quantifying new variants in a geographical area, even prior to the reports by the medical testing.

161	10.1038/s41598-021-94055-1	While there has been significant progress in the development of rapid COVID-19 diagnostics, as the pandemic unfolds, new challenges have emerged, including whether these technologies can reliably detect the more infectious variants of concern and be viably deployed in non-clinical settings as “self-tests”. Multidisciplinary evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card (BinaxNOW, a widely used rapid antigen test, included limit of detection, variant detection, test performance across different age-groups, and usability with self/caregiver-administration.

162	10.3389/fimmu.2021.752003	The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have become a major concern in the containment of current pandemic. The variants, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) have shown reduced sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies, plasma and/or sera obtained from convalescent patients and vaccinated individuals. Development of potent therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with broad neutralizing breadth have become a priority for alleviating the devastating effects of this pandemic. Here, we review some of the most promising broadly neutralizing antibodies obtained from plasma of patients that recovered from early variants of SARS-CoV-2 that may be effective against emerging new variants of the virus. This review summarizes several mAbs, that have been discovered to cross-neutralize across Sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants. Understanding the characteristics that confer this broad and cross-neutralization functions of these mAbs would inform on the development of therapeutic antibodies and guide the discovery of second-generation vaccines.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera | level: lower

We report SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 12,476 patients in the Houston Methodist healthcare system diagnosed from January 1 through May 31, 2021. Prevalence of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant increased rapidly and caused 63%-90% of new cases in the latter half of May. Eleven B.1.1.7 genomes had an E484K replacement in spike protein, a change also identified in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Compared with non-B.1.1.7-infected patients, individuals with B.1.1.7 had a significantly lower cycle threshold (a proxy for higher virus load) and significantly higher hospitalization rate. Other variants (e.g., B.1.429 and B.1.427 (Epsilon), P.1 (Gamma), P.2 (Zeta), and R.1) also increased rapidly, although the magnitude was less than B.1.1.7. We identified 22 patients infected with B.1.617.1 (Kappa) or B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants; these patients had a high rate of hospitalization. Breakthrough cases (n=207) in fully vaccinated patients were caused by a heterogeneous array of virus genotypes, including many that are not currently designated variants of interest or concern. In the aggregate, our study delineates the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in a major metropolitan area, documents B.1.1.7 as the major cause of new cases in Houston, and heralds the arrival of B.1.617 variants in the metroplex.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: ct_value | level: lower

173	10.1101/2021.08.12.456173	SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has rapidly replaced the Alpha variant around the world. The mechanism that drives this global replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: viral_replication | level: higher

The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.	mutation_name: SPIKE_P681R | effect: infectivity | level: higher

180	10.1038/s41586-021-04245-0	Beginning in the summer of 2020, a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerged in the United Kingdom. This B.1.1.7 variant, also known as Alpha, increased rapidly in prevalence, attributed to an increase in infection and/or transmission efficiency1. The Alpha variant has 19 nonsynonymous mutations across its viral genome, including 8 substitutions or deletions in the spike protein, which interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we show that, of the 8 individual spike protein substitutions, only N501Y exhibited consistent fitness gains for replication in the upper airway in the hamster model as well as primary human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 Alpha spike mutations, suggesting it is a major determinant of increased transmission of this variant. Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in Brazil, South Africa, and elsewhere2,3, our results indicate that N501Y substitution is a major adaptive spike mutation of major concern.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: infectivity | level: higher

Molnupiravir (MK-4482), an orally administered nucleoside analog, has demonstrated efficacy against earlier SARS-CoV-2 lineages and was recently approved for SARS-CoV-2 infections in high-risk adults. Here we assessed the efficacy of MK-4482 against the earlier Alpha, Beta and Delta VOCs and Omicron in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron replication and associated lung disease in vehicle treated hamsters was reduced compared to the earlier VOCs. MK-4482 treatment inhibited virus replication in the lungs of Alpha, Beta and Delta VOC infected hamsters. Importantly, MK-4482 profoundly inhibited virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters infected with the Omicron VOC. Consistent with its mutagenic mechanism, MK-4482 treatment had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on infectious virus titers compared to viral RNA genome load. Histopathologic analysis showed that MK-4482 treatment caused a concomitant reduction in the level of lung disease and viral antigen load in infected hamsters across all VOCs examined. Together, our data indicate the potential of MK-4482 as an effective antiviral against known SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, especially Omicron, and likely future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Starting from published cell infection and viral replication data for the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant, we explore variability in outcomes of viral load and cell infection due to three plausible mechanisms altered by SARS-CoV-2 mutations of delta and omicron. We seek a mechanistic explanation of clinical test results: delta nasal infections express ∼3 orders-of-magnitude higher viral load than alpha, while omicron infections express an additional 1 to 2 orders-of-magnitude rise over delta. Model simulations reveal shortening of the eclipse phase (the time between cellular uptake of the virus and onset of infectious viral replication and shedding) alone can generate 3-5 orders-of-magnitude higher viral load within 2 days post initial infection. Higher viral replication rates by an infected cell can generate at most one order-of-magnitude rise in viral load, whereas higher cell infectability has minimal impact and lowers the viral load.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: viral_load | level: higher

Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Methods Hamsters were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Animals were followed for weight loss, and upper and lower respiratory tract tissues were assessed for viral loads and histopathology. Findings Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10-17% weight loss by day 6. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts but demonstrated lower viral loads in lung parenchyma and reduced pulmonary pathology compared with WA1/2020 infection. Conclusions These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in robust upper respiratory tract infection but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Findings Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10-17% weight loss by day 6. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts but demonstrated lower viral loads in lung parenchyma and reduced pulmonary pathology compared with WA1/2020 infection. Conclusions These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in robust upper respiratory tract infection but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants.

192	10.1016/j.medj.2022.03.004	Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has proven highly transmissible and has outcompeted the Delta variant in many regions of the world. Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Methods Hamsters were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or other SARS-CoV-2 variants.

193	10.1101/2021.11.24.21266748	Background The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the predominant UK circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain in May 2021. How Delta infection compares with previous variants is unknown. Methods This prospective observational cohort study assessed symptomatic adults participating in the app-based COVID Symptom Study who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from May 26 to July 1, 2021 (Delta overwhelmingly predominant circulating UK variant), compared (1:1, age- and sex-matched) with individuals presenting from December 28, 2020 to May 6, 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) predominant variant). We assessed illness (symptoms, duration, presentation to hospital) during Alpha- and Delta-predominant timeframes; and transmission, reinfection, and vaccine effectiveness during the Delta-predominant period. Findings 3,581 individuals (aged 18 to 100 years) from each timeframe were assessed. The seven most frequent symptoms were common to both variants. Within the first 28 days of illness, some symptoms were more common with Delta vs. Alpha infection (including fever, sore throat and headache) and vice versa (dyspnoea). Symptom burden in the first week was higher with Delta vs. Alpha infection; however, the odds of any given symptom lasting [≥]7 days was either lower or unchanged. Illness duration [≥]28 days was lower with Delta vs. Alpha infection, though unchanged in unvaccinated individuals. Hospitalisation for COVID-19 was unchanged. The Delta variant appeared more (1.47) transmissible than Alpha. Re-infections were low in all UK regions. Vaccination markedly (69-84%) reduced risk of Delta infection. Interpretation COVID-19 from Delta or Alpha infections is clinically similar. The Delta variant is more transmissible than Alpha; however, current vaccines show good efficacy against disease.

199	10.2139/ssrn.3861566	Background: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) on disease severity is unclear. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared outcomes of patients infected with B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 with those with wild-type strains from early 2020.Methods: National surveillance data from 1-January-2021 to 22-May-2021 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, and outcomes in relation to VOC were explored. Detailed patient level data from all SARS-CoV-2 patients with VOC infection admitted to our centre between 20-December-2020 and 12-May-2021 were analysed. Outcomes were compared with a cohort of 846 patients admitted January-April 2020.Findings: There were 838 VOC infections in Singapore in the study period. After adjusting for age and gender, B.1.617.2 infection was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or death (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4·90, [95% CI 1·43-30·78]. 157 patients with VOCs were admitted to our centre. After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and vaccination, aOR for pneumonia with B.1.617.2 was 1·88 [95% CI 0·95-3·76]) compared with wild-type. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and significantly longer duration of Ct value ≤30 (estimated median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2, 13 days for wild-type). Vaccine breakthrough cases were less severe.Interpretation: There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility.

205	10.1007/s00253-021-11676-2	The progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has generated numerous emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 on a global scale. These variants have gained evolutionary advantages, comprising high virulence and serious infectivity due to multiple spike glycoprotein mutations. As a reason, variants are demonstrating significant abilities to escape the immune responses of the host. The D614G mutation in the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 variants has shown the most efficient interaction with the ACE2 receptor of the cells. This explicit mutation at amino acid position 614 (aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution) is the prime cause of infection and re-infection. It changes the conformation of RBD and cleavage patterns S-glycoprotein with higher stability, replication fitness, and fusion efficiencies. Therefore, this review aims to provide several crucial pieces of information associated with the D614 mutational occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their infectivity patterns. This review will also effectively emphasize the mechanism of action of D614G mutant variants, immune escape, and partial vaccine escape of this virus. Furthermore, the viral characteristic changes leading to the current global pandemic condition have been highlighted. Here, we have tried to illustrate a novel direction for future researchers to develop effective therapeutic approaches and counterweight strategies to minimize the spread of COVID-19. Key points • D614G mutation arises within the S-glycoprotein of significant SARS-CoV-2 variants. • The D614G mutation affects infection, re-infection, cleavage patterns of S-glycoprotein, and replication fitness of SARS-CoV-2 variants. • The D614G mutation influences the immunity and partial vaccine escape.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

The mutation P323L in RdRp is associated with the loss of a particular epitope (321-327) from this protein which may influence the pathogenesis of the concern SARS-CoV-2 through the development of antibody escape variants. We consider the effect of mutations in some of the epitope regions including the naturally occurring mutation P323L on the structure of the epitope and their interface with paratope using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. P323L mutations cause conformational changes in the epitope region by opening up the region associated with increase in the radius of gyration and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, making the region less accessible. Moreover, the fluctuations in the dihedral angles in the epitope:paratope (IgG) interface increase which destabilize the interface.

216	10.3389/fcell.2021.697035	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been undergoing various mutations. The analysis of the structural and energetic effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will be beneficial for epidemic surveillance, diagnosis, and optimization of neutralizing agents. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, a key mutation N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region created a new salt bridge with Glu329 of hACE2, which resulted in greater electrostatic complementarity, and created a weak salt bridge with Asp442 of RBD. Furthermore, the N439K-mutated RBD bound hACE2 with a higher affinity than wild-type, which may lead to more infectious. In addition, the N439K-mutated RBD was markedly resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody REGN10987, which may lead to the failure of neutralization. The results show consistent with the previous experimental conclusion and clarify the structural mechanism under affinity changes. Our methods will offer guidance on the assessment of the infection efficiency and antigenicity effect of continuing mutations in SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N439K | effect: host_virus_interactions | level: higher

220	10.3390/biom11091273	The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates the viral–host interaction and is a target for most neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations pose a threat due to their role in host cell entry via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor that might strengthen SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, viral load, or resistance against neutralizing antibodies. To understand the molecular structural link between RBD mutations and infectivity, the top five mutant RBDs (i.e., N501Y, E484K L452R, S477N, and N439K) were selected based on their recorded case numbers. These mutants along with wild-type (WT) RBD were studied through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 100 ns. The principal component analysis and the free energy landscape were used too. Interestingly, N501Y, N439K, and E484K mutations were observed to increase the rigidity in some RBD regions while increasing the flexibility of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region, suggesting a compensation of the entropy penalty. However, S477N and L452R RBDs were observed to increase the flexibility of the RBM region while maintaining similar flexibility in other RBD regions in comparison to WT RBD. Therefore, both mutations (especially S477N) might destabilize the RBD structure, as loose conformation compactness was observed. The destabilizing effect of S477N RBD was consistent with previous work on S477N mutation. Finally, the free energy landscape results showed that mutations changed WT RBD conformation while local minima were maintained for all mutant RBDs.

Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations pose a threat due to their role in host cell entry via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor that might strengthen SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, viral load, or resistance against neutralizing antibodies. To understand the molecular structural link between RBD mutations and infectivity, the top five mutant RBDs (i.e., N501Y, E484K L452R, S477N, and N439K) were selected based on their recorded case numbers. These mutants along with wild-type (WT) RBD were studied through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 100 ns. The principal component analysis and the free energy landscape were used too. Interestingly, N501Y, N439K, and E484K mutations were observed to increase the rigidity in some RBD regions while increasing the flexibility of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region, suggesting a compensation of the entropy penalty. However, S477N and L452R RBDs were observed to increase the flexibility of the RBM region while maintaining similar flexibility in other RBD regions in comparison to WT RBD. Therefore, both mutations (especially S477N) might destabilize the RBD structure, as loose conformation compactness was observed. The destabilizing effect of S477N RBD was consistent with previous work on S477N mutation. Finally, the free energy landscape results showed that mutations changed WT RBD conformation while local minima were maintained for all mutant RBDs. In conclusion, RBD mutations definitely impact the WT RBD structure and conformation as well as increase the binding affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect: protein_flexibility | level: lower

229	10.1080/07391102.2022.2051746	Mutations drive viral evolution and genome variability that causes viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. SARS-CoV-2 has considerably higher mutation rate. SARS-CoV-2 possesses a RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which helps to replicate its genome. The mutation P323L in RdRp is associated with the loss of a particular epitope (321-327) from this protein. We consider the effects of mutations in some of the epitope region including the naturally occurring mutation P323L on the structure of the epitope and their interface with paratope using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. We observe that the mutations cause conformational changes in the epitope region by opening up the region associated with increase in the radius of gyration and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, making the region less accessible. Moreover, we study the conformational stability of the epitope region and epitope:paratope interface under the mutation from the fluctuations in the dihedral angles. We observe that the mutation renders the epitope and the epitope:paratope interface unstable compared to the corresponding wild type ones.

230	10.1101/2020.07.04.187757	Virus genome sequence variants that appear over the course of an outbreak can be exploited to map the trajectory of the virus from one susceptible host to another. While such variants are usually of no functional significance, in some cases they may allow the virus to transmit faster, change disease severity, or confer resistance to antiviral therapies. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of COVID-19, the virus has spread around the globe, and thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced. The rate of sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates is modest for an RNA virus but the enormous number of human-to-human transmission events has provided abundant opportunity for selection of sequence variants. Among these, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant, D614G, was not present in the presumptive common ancestor of this zoonotic virus but was first detected in late January in Germany and China. The D614G variant steadily increased in frequency and now constitutes >97% of isolates world-wide, raising the question whether D614G confers a replication advantage to SARS-CoV-2. Structural models predict that D614G would disrupt contacts between the S1 and S2 domains of the Spike protein and cause significant shifts in conformation. Using single-cycle vectors we showed that D614G is three to nine-fold more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung and colon cell lines, as well as on other human cell lines rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2, or by ACE2 orthologues from pangolin, pig, dog, or cat. Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein retain full neutralization potency. These results suggest that D614G was selected for increased human-to-human transmission, that it contributed to the rapidity of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world, and that it does not confer resistance to antiviral therapies targeting the receptor binding domain.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect: protein_conformational_optimization | level: no evidence

247	10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102779	Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been emerging in the form of different variants since its first emergence in early December 2019. A new Variant of Concern (VOC) named the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was reported recently. This variant has a large number of mutations in the S protein. To date, there exists a limited information on the Omicron variant. Here we present the analyses of mutation distribution, the evolutionary relationship of Omicron with previous variants, and probable structural impact of mutations on antibody binding. Our analyses show the presence of 46 high prevalence mutations specific to Omicron. Twenty-three of these are localized within the spike (S) protein and the rest localized to the other 3 structural proteins of the virus, the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Omicron is closely related to the Gamma (P.1) variant. The structural analyses showed that several mutations are localized to the region of the S protein that is the major target of antibodies, suggesting that the mutations in the Omicron variant may affect the binding affinities of antibodies to the S protein.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect: binding_to_antibodies | level: no evidence

We previously demonstrated that the other SARS-CoV-2 VoCs replicate efficiently in Syrian hamsters, alike also the ancestral strains.

Strikingly, in hamsters that had been infected with the omicron variant, a 3 log10 lower viral RNA load was detected in the lungs as compared to animals infected with D614G and no infectious virus was detectable in this organ. Moreover, histopathological examination of the lungs from omicron-infecetd hamsters revealed no signs of peri-bronchial inflammation or bronchopneumonia. Further experiments are needed to determine whether the omicron VoC replicates possibly more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract of hamsters than in their lungs.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect: viral_load | level: lower

251	10.1128/spectrum.02732-21	The process of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic diversification is still ongoing and has very recently led to the emergence of a new variant of concern (VOC), defined as Omicron or B.1.1.529. Omicron VOC is the most divergent variant identified so far and has generated immediate concern for its potential capability to increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and, more worryingly, to escape therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies. Nevertheless, a clear definition of the Omicron VOC mutational spectrum is still missing. Herein, we provide a comprehensive definition and functional characterization (in terms of infectivity and/or antigenicity) of mutations characterizing the Omicron VOC. In particular, 887,475 SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC whole-genome sequences were retrieved from the GISAID database and used to precisely define its specific patterns of mutations across the different viral proteins. In addition, the functional characterization of Omicron VOC spike mutations was finely discussed according to published manuscripts. Lastly, residues characterizing the Omicron VOC and the previous four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) were mapped on the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to assess their localization in the different spike domains. Overall, our study will assist with deciphering the Omicron VOC mutational profile and will shed more light on its clinical implications. This is critical considering that Omicron VOC is currently the predominant variant worldwide. IMPORTANCE The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) has a peculiar spectrum of mutations characterized by the acquisition of mutations or deletions rarely detected in previously identified variants, particularly in the spike glycoprotein.

252	10.1128/spectrum.02732-21	The process of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic diversification is still ongoing and has very recently led to the emergence of a new variant of concern (VOC), defined as Omicron or B.1.1.529. Omicron VOC is the most divergent variant identified so far and has generated immediate concern for its potential capability to increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and, more worryingly, to escape therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies. Nevertheless, a clear definition of the Omicron VOC mutational spectrum is still missing. Herein, we provide a comprehensive definition and functional characterization (in terms of infectivity and/or antigenicity) of mutations characterizing the Omicron VOC. In particular, 887,475 SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC whole-genome sequences were retrieved from the GISAID database and used to precisely define its specific patterns of mutations across the different viral proteins. In addition, the functional characterization of Omicron VOC spike mutations was finely discussed according to published manuscripts. Lastly, residues characterizing the Omicron VOC and the previous four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) were mapped on the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to assess their localization in the different spike domains. Overall, our study will assist with deciphering the Omicron VOC mutational profile and will shed more light on its clinical implications. This is critical considering that Omicron VOC is currently the predominant variant worldwide. IMPORTANCE The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) has a peculiar spectrum of mutations characterized by the acquisition of mutations or deletions rarely detected in previously identified variants, particularly in the spike glycoprotein. Such mutations, mostly residing in the receptor-binding domain, could play a pivotal role in enhancing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity (by increasing binding affinity for ACE2), jeopardizing spike recognition by therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies and causing diagnostic assay failure.

257	10.1002/jmv.27526	Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially those of concern, may have an impact on the virus's transmissibility and pathogenicity, as well as diagnostic equipment performance and vaccine effectiveness. Even though the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) emerged during India's second wave of infections, Delta variants have grown dominant internationally and are still evolving. On November 26, 2021, WHO identified the variant B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern, naming it Omicron, based on evidence that Omicron contains numerous mutations that may influence its behaviour. However, the mode of transmission and severity of the Omicron variant remains unknown. We used computational studies to examine the Delta and Omicron variants in this work and found that the Omicron variant had a higher affinity for human ACE2 than the Delta variant due to a significant number of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, indicating a higher potential for transmission. Based on docking studies, the Q493R, N501Y, S371L, S373P, S375F, Q498R, and T478K mutations contribute significantly to high binding affinity with human ACE2. In comparison to the Delta variant, both the entire spike protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in Omicron include a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine. These amino acids are located within the protein's core and are required for structural stability. We observed a disorder-order transition in the Omicron variant between spike protein RBD regions 468-473, and it may be significant in the influence of disordered residues/regions on spike protein stability and binding to ACE2. A future study might investigate the epidemiological and biological consequences of the Omicron variant. This article is protected by copyright.

Here we used a simple adapted N95 mask sampling method to demonstrate the impact of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccination on 92 COVID-19 patients to expel virus into the air translating to a transmission risk. Between July and September 2021, when the Delta was the dominant circulating strain in Mumbai, we noted a two-fold increase in the proportion of people expelling virus (95%), about an eighty-fold increase in median viral load and a three-fold increase in high emitter type (41%; people expelling >1000 viral copy numbers in 30 minutes) compared to initial strains of 2020. Eight percent of these patients continued to be high emitters even after eight days of symptom onset, suggesting a probable increased transmission risk for Delta strain even at this stage. There was no significant difference in expelling pattern between partial, full and un-vaccinated individuals suggesting similar transmission risk. We noted significantly more infections among vaccinated study patients and their household members than unvaccinated, probably due to increased duration from vaccination and/or increased risk behaviour upon vaccination due to lower perceived threat. This study provides biological evidence for possible continued transmission of the Delta strain even with vaccination, emphasizing the need to continue COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The study also indicates that the mask method may be useful for screening future vaccine candidates, therapeutics or interventions for their ability to block transmission.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

The spreading of COVID-19 in different chinese cities and around the world is travel-related viral spread with the unprecedented nosocomial outbreaks. It has also shown with high case-fatality rates, indeed to urgent prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Scientific advancements of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic allowed for rapid progress to understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. This review highlights the the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 with the proposed roles of genotype and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 in pathogenesis and discuss recent results supporting treatment strategies of COVID-19 with a special focus on how these new insights may facilitate rational development of SARS-CoV-2 for targeted therapies in the future.	mutation_name:  | effect:  | level:

The precise role of clinical and genomic determinants in Delta infections is not known, and whether they contribute to increased rates of breakthrough infections compared to unvaccinated controls. Here, we show a steep and near complete replacement of circulating variants with Delta between May and August 2021 in metropolitan New York. We observed an increase of the Delta sublineage AY.25, its spike mutation S112L, and nsp12 mutation F192V in breakthroughs. Delta infections were associated with younger age and lower hospitalization rates than Alpha. Delta breakthroughs increased significantly with time since vaccination, and, after adjusting for confounders, they rose at similar rates as in unvaccinated individuals. Our data indicate a limited impact of vaccine escape in favor of Delta’s increased epidemic growth in times of waning vaccine protection.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: risk_of_hospitalization | level: lower

There were 296 (40.5%) positive tests by RT-PCR; 97% of a random sample were the omicron variant. Sensitivity of a single antigen test was 95.2% (95% CI 92-98%); 82.1% (95% CI 77-87%) and 65.2% (95% CI 60-70%) for Ct threshold of < 30, < 35 and no threshold, respectively. A single BinaxNowTM rapid antigen test detected 95% of high viral load omicron cases from nasal specimens. As currently recommended, repeat testing should be done for high- risk persons with an initial negative antigen test result.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics | level: unaffected

We first review the question of the route of contamination and of the dose following exposure, and the importance of the counting unit for pathogens, itself linked to the dose-response law. Using the counting unit of Wells, i.e. the quantum of contagium, we develop the conservation equation of quanta which allows deriving the value of the quantum concentration at steady state for a well-mixed room. With the choice of an exponential response function, this leads to the famous Wells-Riley equation. The analysis points out the importance of a number of parameters such as the time of exposure, the quantum production rate, mask wearing and the incidence rate in the population in order to evaluate the risk. The link with the monitoring concentration of carbon dioxide is made and used for a risk analysis of a variety of situations for which we have made concrete CO2 time monitoring. The main conclusion of these observations is that the present norms of ventilation, already insufficient, are not respected, especially in a variety of public premises, leading to high risk of contamination. Finally, we insist that public health policy in the field of airborne transmission should be based on a multi parameter analysis, considering the whole complexity of dose evaluation.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: viral_load | level: higher

In winter of 2021-2022, the omicron variant surge made it quickly apparent that although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are less sensitive than qRT-PCR, the accessibility, ease of use, and rapid read-outs of RDTs made them a sought after and often sold-out item at local suppliers. Here, we sought to qualify the BinaxNOWTM test for use in our university testing program as a method to rule in positive or rule out negative individuals quickly when they sought care at our priority qRT-PCR testing site. To perform this qualification study, we collected matched additional swabs from individuals attending this test site for standard of care qRT-PCR testing. All matched swabs were tested using the BinaxNOWTM RDT. 48 of 110 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All samples for which genome sequence could be collected were omicron (41). We observed a calculated sensitivity of 52.1%, specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 72.9% for the BinaxNOWTM tests (n=110). Sensitivity was improved (75.7%) by changing the qRT-PCR positivity threshold from a CT of 40 to a CT of 30. The ROC curve shows that for qRT-PCR positive CT values between 23-40, the BinaxNOWTM test is of limited value diagnostically. Our results suggest that RDT tests could be used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with substantial viral load, but that a significant fraction of infected individuals would be missed if we used RDT tests exclusively at this time.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics | level: unaffected
272	10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103997	BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is rampantly spreading across the globe. We assessed the pathogenicity and immune response generated by BA.1.1 sub-lineage of SARS-CoV-2 [Omicron (R346K) variant] in 5 to 6-week old Syrian hamsters and compared the observations with that of Delta variant infection. METHODS: Virus shedding, organ viral load, lung disease and immune response generated in hamsters were sequentially assessed. FINDINGS: The disease characteristics of the Omicron (R346K) variant were found to be similar to that of the Delta variant infection in hamsters like viral replication in the respiratory tract and interstitial pneumonia. The Omicron (R346K) infected hamsters demonstrated lesser body weight reduction and viral RNA load in the throat swab and nasal wash samples in comparison to the Delta variant infection. The viral load in the lungs and nasal turbinate samples and the lung disease severity of the Omicron (R346K) infected hamsters were found comparable with that of the Delta variant infected hamsters. Neutralizing antibody response against Omicron (R346K) variant was detected from day 5 and the cross-neutralization titre of the sera against other variants showed severe reduction ie., 7 fold reduction against Alpha and no titers against B.1, Beta and Delta. INTERPRETATION: This preliminary data shows that Omicron (R346K) variant infection can produce moderate to severe lung disease similar to that of the Delta variant and the neutralizing antibodies produced in response to Omicron (R346K) variant infection shows poor neutralizing ability against other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants like Delta which necessitates caution as it may lead to increased cases of reinfection.

The in vivo pathogenicity, transmissibility, and fitness of this new Variant of Concerns are unknown. We investigated these virological attributes of the Omicron variant in comparison with those of the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in the golden Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron-infected hamsters developed significantly less body weight losses, clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine/chemokine dysregulation, and tissue damages than Delta-infected hamsters. The Omicron and Delta variant were both highly transmissible (100% vs 100%) via contact transmission. Importantly, the Omicron variant consistently demonstrated about 10-20% higher transmissibility than the already-highly transmissible Delta variant in repeated non-contact transmission studies (overall: 30/36 vs 24/36, 83.3% vs 66.7%). The Delta variant displayed higher fitness advantage than the Omicron variant without selection pressure in both in vitro and in vivo competition models. However, this scenario drastically changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies active against the Delta variant but poorly active against the Omicron variant were introduced, with the Omicron variant significantly outcompeting the Delta variant. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that while the Omicron variant is less pathogenic than the Delta variant, it is highly transmissible and can outcompete the Delta variant under immune selection pressure. Next-generation vaccines and antivirals effective against this new VOC are urgently needed.

288	10.1101/2022.03.02.482662	Coronavirus disease 2019 continues to batter the world with the unceasing introduction of new variants of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. In order to understand differences in disease caused by variants of concern and to develop variant-specific vaccines, suitable small animal models are required that mimic disease progression in humans at various stages of life. In this study, we compared the dynamics of infection with two SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Delta and Omicron) in aged (>1 year 3 months old) and young (<5 weeks old) Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We show that no weight loss occurred in Omicron infected groups regardless of age, while infection with the Delta variant caused weight loss of up to 10% by day 7 post-infection with slower and incomplete recovery in the aged group. Omicron replicated to similar levels as Delta in the lungs, trachea and nasal turbinates, with no significant differences in the tissue viral loads of aged versus young animals for either variant. In contrast to rare necrosis observed in Omicron-infected animals regardless of age, severe necrosis was observed in the olfactory epithelium in Delta-infected animals.

289	10.1101/2022.03.02.482662	Coronavirus disease 2019 continues to batter the world with the unceasing introduction of new variants of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. In order to understand differences in disease caused by variants of concern and to develop variant-specific vaccines, suitable small animal models are required that mimic disease progression in humans at various stages of life. In this study, we compared the dynamics of infection with two SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Delta and Omicron) in aged (>1 year 3 months old) and young (<5 weeks old) Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We show that no weight loss occurred in Omicron infected groups regardless of age, while infection with the Delta variant caused weight loss of up to 10% by day 7 post-infection with slower and incomplete recovery in the aged group. Omicron replicated to similar levels as Delta in the lungs, trachea and nasal turbinates, with no significant differences in the tissue viral loads of aged versus young animals for either variant. In contrast to rare necrosis observed in Omicron-infected animals regardless of age, severe necrosis was observed in the olfactory epithelium in Delta-infected animals. Omicron infection also resulted in mild pulmonary disease in both young and aged animals compared to the moderate acute necrotizing bronchointerstitial pneumonia seen in Delta-infected animals. These results suggest that Omicron infection results in an attenuated clinical disease outlook in Syrian hamsters compared to infection with the Delta variant irrespective of age.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: disease_severity | level: higher

We investigated effects of Omicron subvariant (BA.1 and BA.2), previous vaccination, and prior infection on infectiousness of Omicron infections, between December 23, 2021 and February 20, 2022. METHODS: Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to estimate the association between the RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR tests (a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness) and each of the Omicron subvariants, mRNA vaccination, prior infection, reason for RT-qPCR testing, calendar week of RT-qPCR testing (to account for phases of the rapidly evolving Omicron wave), and demographic factors. RESULTS: Compared to BA.1, BA.2 was associated with 3.53 fewer cycles (95% CI: 3.46-3.60), signifying higher infectiousness. Ct value decreased with time since second and third vaccinations. Ct values were highest for those who received their boosters in the month preceding the RT-qPCR test - 0.86 cycles (95% CI: 0.72-1.00) higher than for unvaccinated persons. Ct value was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.20-1.39) cycles higher for those with a prior infection compared to those without prior infection, signifying lower infectiousness. Ct value declined gradually with age. Ct value was lowest for those who were tested because of symptoms and was highest for those who were tested for travel-related purposes. Ct value was lowest during the exponential-growth phase of the Omicron wave and was highest after the wave peaked and was declining. CONCLUSIONS: The BA.2 subvariant appears substantially more infectious than the BA.1 subvariant. This may reflect higher viral load and/or longer duration of infection, thereby explaining the rapid expansion of this subvariant in Qatar.	mutation_name: BA.1 | effect: ct_value | level: lower

To understand this phenomenon, we used various bioinformatics approaches to analyze randomly selected genome sequences (one each) of the Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants submitted to NCBI from 15 to 31 December 2021. We show that: (i) Pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants decreases in the order: Wuhan > Gamma > Delta > Omicron; however, the antigenic property follows the order: Omicron > Gamma > Wuhan > Delta. (ii) Omicron Spike RBD has lower pathogenicity but higher antigenicity than other variants. (iii) Decreased disease severity by Omicron variant may be due to its decreased pro-inflammatory and IL-6 stimulation and increased IFN-γ and IL-4 induction efficacy. (iv) Mutations in N protein are associated with decreased IL-6 induction and human DDX21-mediated increased IL-4 production in Omicron. (v) Due to mutations, the stability of S, M, N, and E proteins decreases in the order: Omicron > Gamma > Delta > Wuhan. (vi) Stronger Spike RBD-hACE2 binding in Omicron is associated with increased transmissibility. However, the lowest stability of the Omicron Spike protein makes Spike RBD-hACE2 interaction weak for systemic infection and for causing severe disease. Finally (vii), the highest instability of Omicron E protein may also be associated with decreased viral maturation and low viral load leading to less severe disease and faster recovery.

304	10.3389/fimmu.2022.836232	The continuous emergence of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, especially the variants of concern (VOC), exacerbated the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the key of viral entry into host cells, the spike (S) protein is the major target of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies elicited by infection or vaccination. However, the mutations of S protein in variants may change the infectivity and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the immune escape from those neutralizing antibodies. To characterize the mutations of S protein in newly emerging variants, the proteolytic property and binding affinity with receptor were assessed, and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus system was used to assess the infectivity and immune escape. We found that some SARS-CoV-2 variants have changed significantly in viral infectivity; especially, B.1.617.2 is more likely to infect less susceptible cells than D614G, and the virus infection process can be completed in a shorter time. In addition, neutralizing mAbs and vaccinated sera partially or completely failed to inhibit host cell entry mediated by the S protein of certain SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, SARS-CoV-2 variant S protein-mediated viral infection can still be blocked by protease inhibitors and endocytosis inhibitors. This work provides a deeper understanding of the rise and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their immune evasion.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: infectivity | level: lower

Here, we study the antigenic and structural impacts of the S protein mutations from four variants, one that was involved in transmission between minks and humans, and three that rapidly spread in human populations and originated in the United Kingdom, Brazil or South Africa. All variants either retained or improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. The B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.1.28 (Brazil) spike variants showed reduced binding to neutralizing NTD and RBD antibodies, respectively, while the B.1.351 (SA) variant showed reduced binding to both NTD- and RBD-directed antibodies. Cryo-EM structural analyses revealed allosteric effects of the mutations on spike conformations and revealed mechanistic differences that either drive inter-species transmission or promotes viral escape from dominant neutralizing epitopes.

Further, we provide a comparative analysis of the mutational effects within variant spikes and identify the structural role of mutations within the NTD and RBD in evading antibody neutralization. Our analysis shows that the highly mutated Gamma N-terminal domain exhibits considerable structural rearrangements, partially explaining its decreased neutralization by convalescent sera.

314	10.1101/2020.09.01.278689	A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an “up” conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

326	10.1002/advs.202105378	The SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta (B.1.617.2) strain is a variant of concern (VOC) that has become the dominant strain worldwide in 2021. Its transmission capacity is approximately twice that of the original strain, with a shorter incubation period and higher viral load during infection. Importantly, the breakthrough infections of the Delta variant have continued to emerge in the first‐generation vaccine recipients. There is thus an urgent need to develop a novel vaccine with SARS‐CoV‐2 variants as the major target. Here, receptor binding domain (RBD)‐conjugated nanoparticle vaccines targeting the Delta variant, as well as the early and Beta/Gamma strains, are developed. Under both a single‐dose and a prime‐boost strategy, these RBD‐conjugated nanoparticle vaccines induce the abundant neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and significantly protect hACE2 mice from infection by the authentic SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta strain, as well as the early and Beta strains. Furthermore, the elicitation of the robust production of broader cross‐protective NAbs against almost all the notable SARS‐CoV‐2 variants including the Omicron variant in rhesus macaques by the third re‐boost with trivalent vaccines is found. These results suggest that RBD‐based monovalent or multivalent nanoparticle vaccines provide a promising second‐generation vaccine strategy for SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

328	10.1002/advs.202105378	The SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta (B.1.617.2) strain is a variant of concern (VOC) that has become the dominant strain worldwide in 2021. Its transmission capacity is approximately twice that of the original strain, with a shorter incubation period and higher viral load during infection. Importantly, the breakthrough infections of the Delta variant have continued to emerge in the first‐generation vaccine recipients. There is thus an urgent need to develop a novel vaccine with SARS‐CoV‐2 variants as the major target. Here, receptor binding domain (RBD)‐conjugated nanoparticle vaccines targeting the Delta variant, as well as the early and Beta/Gamma strains, are developed. Under both a single‐dose and a prime‐boost strategy, these RBD‐conjugated nanoparticle vaccines induce the abundant neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and significantly protect hACE2 mice from infection by the authentic SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta strain, as well as the early and Beta strains.

Methods: The information about the time, area and population distributions of COVID-19 cases in Ejina before November 13, 2021 and the gene sequencing result of the isolates were collected for a statistical descriptive analysis. Results: The first COVID-19 case in Ejina occurred on 7 October, 2021. A total of 164 COVID-19 cases were reported from October 19 to November 12. Most cases were distributed in 6 communities in Darahub (156 cases, 95.12%). The result of full gene sequencing of the isolates indicted that the pathogen was Delta variant (B.1.617.2). The male to female ratio of the cases was 1.3â¶1. The age of cases ranged from 1 to 85 years, and the cases aged 20-59 years accounted for 78.66%. The main clinical symptoms were sore throat (91 cases, 91.92%), cough (49 cases, 49.49%) and fever (23 cases, 23.23%). Most cases were ordinary ones (81 cases, 49.39%) and mild ones (68 cases, 41.46%). The cases were mainly detected at the isolation points (84 cases, 51.22%) and through population based nucleic acid testing (62 cases, 37.80%). The basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was 5.3, the average incubation period was 3.9 days. The local government rapidly started â £ level emergency response and conducted 10 rounds of nucleic acid tests. The transferring of travelers reduced the risk for the further spread of COVID-19 in Ejina. Conclusions: The epidemic of COVID-19 in Ejina characterized by strong transmission, short incubation period, herd susceptibility and case clustering. Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was the pathogen, which might be imported from Zeke port. Comprehensive prevention and control measures, such as closed-loop management and vaccination, should be continued.

336	10.3390/ijerph19031127	Few studies have assessed incubation periods of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Delta variant. This study aimed to elucidate the transmission dynamics, especially the incubation period, for the Delta variant compared with non-Delta strains. We studied unvaccinated coronavirus disease 2019 patients with definite single exposure date from August 2020 to September 2021 in Japan. The incubation periods were calculated and compared by Mann–Whitney U test for Delta (with L452R mutation) and non-Delta cases. We estimated mean and percentiles of incubation period by fitting parametric distribution to data in the Bayesian statistical framework. We enrolled 214 patients (121 Delta and 103 non-Delta cases) with one specific date of exposure to the virus. The mean incubation period was 3.7 days and 4.9 days for Delta and non-Delta cases, respectively (p-value = 0.000). When lognormal distributions were fitted, the estimated mean incubation periods were 3.7 (95% credible interval (CI) 3.4–4.0) and 5.0 (95% CI 4.5–5.6) days for Delta and non-Delta cases, respectively. The estimated 97.5th percentile of incubation period was 6.9 (95% CI 5.9–8.0) days and 10.4 (95% CI 8.6–12.7) days for Delta and non–Delta cases, respectively. Unvaccinated Delta variant cases had shorter incubation periods than non–Delta variant cases.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: viral_incubation_period | level: lower
337	10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101129	BACKGROUND: A novel variant of SARS-CoV-2, the Delta variant of concern (VOC, also known as lineage B.1.617.2), is fast becoming the dominant strain globally. We reported the epidemiological, viral, and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients infected with the Delta VOC during the local outbreak in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: We extracted the epidemiological and clinical information pertaining to the 159 cases infected with the Delta VOC across seven transmission generations between May 21 and June 18, 2021. The whole chain of the Delta VOC transmission was described. Kinetics of viral load and clinical characteristics were compared with a cohort of wild-type infection in 2020 admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. FINDINGS: There were four transmission generations within the first ten days. The Delta VOC yielded a significantly shorter incubation period (4.0 vs. 6.0 days), higher viral load (20.6 vs. 34.0, cycle threshold of the ORF1a/b gene), and a longer duration of viral shedding in pharyngeal swab samples (14.0 vs. 8.0 days) compared with the wild-type strain. In cases with critical illness, the proportion of patients over the age of 60 was higher in the Delta VOC group than in the wild-type strain (100.0% vs. 69.2%, p = 0.03). The Delta VOC had a higher risk than wild-type infection in deterioration to critical status (hazards ratio 2.98 [95%CI 1.29-6.86]; p = 0.01). INTERPRETATION: Infection with the Delta VOC is characterized by markedly increased transmissibility, viral loads and risk of disease progression compared with the wild-type strain, calling for more intensive prevention and control measures to contain future outbreaks.

We evaluated the transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the Delta variant in an outbreak in southern China. Methods: Data on confirmed cases and their close contacts were retrospectively collected from the outbreak that occurred in Guangdong, China in May-June 2021. Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated and compared between the Delta variant and the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. Results: We identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. The mean estimates of the latent period and the incubation period were 4.0 days and 5.8 days, respectively. A relatively higher viral load was observed in Delta cases than in wild-type infections. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of Delta cases was 1.4%, and 73.9% (95% confidence interval: 67.2%, 81.3%) of the transmissions occurred before onset. Index cases without vaccination (OR: 2.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 8.45) or with one dose of vaccination (OR: 6.02, 95% confidence interval: 2.45, 18.16) were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received 2 doses of vaccination. Discussion: Patients infected with the Delta variant had more rapid symptom onset. The shorter and time-varying serial interval should be accounted in estimation of reproductive numbers.

345	10.1101/2022.01.12.476031	The newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant first identified in South Africa in November 2021 is characterized by an unusual number of amino acid mutations in its spike that renders existing vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies dramatically less effective. The in vivo pathogenicity, transmissibility, and fitness of this new Variant of Concerns are unknown. We investigated these virological attributes of the Omicron variant in comparison with those of the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in the golden Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron-infected hamsters developed significantly less body weight losses, clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine/chemokine dysregulation, and tissue damages than Delta-infected hamsters. The Omicron and Delta variant were both highly transmissible (100% vs 100%) via contact transmission. Importantly, the Omicron variant consistently demonstrated about 10-20% higher transmissibility than the already-highly transmissible Delta variant in repeated non-contact transmission studies (overall: 30/36 vs 24/36, 83.3% vs 66.7%). The Delta variant displayed higher fitness advantage than the Omicron variant without selection pressure in both in vitro and in vivo competition models. However, this scenario drastically changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies active against the Delta variant but poorly active against the Omicron variant were introduced, with the Omicron variant significantly outcompeting the Delta variant. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that while the Omicron variant is less pathogenic than the Delta variant, it is highly transmissible and can outcompete the Delta variant under immune selection pressure. Next-generation vaccines and antivirals effective against this new VOC are urgently needed.

346	10.1101/2022.01.12.476031	The newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant first identified in South Africa in November 2021 is characterized by an unusual number of amino acid mutations in its spike that renders existing vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies dramatically less effective. The in vivo pathogenicity, transmissibility, and fitness of this new Variant of Concerns are unknown. We investigated these virological attributes of the Omicron variant in comparison with those of the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in the golden Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron-infected hamsters developed significantly less body weight losses, clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine/chemokine dysregulation, and tissue damages than Delta-infected hamsters. The Omicron and Delta variant were both highly transmissible (100% vs 100%) via contact transmission. Importantly, the Omicron variant consistently demonstrated about 10-20% higher transmissibility than the already-highly transmissible Delta variant in repeated non-contact transmission studies (overall: 30/36 vs 24/36, 83.3% vs 66.7%). The Delta variant displayed higher fitness advantage than the Omicron variant without selection pressure in both in vitro and in vivo competition models. However, this scenario drastically changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies active against the Delta variant but poorly active against the Omicron variant were introduced, with the Omicron variant significantly outcompeting the Delta variant. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that while the Omicron variant is less pathogenic than the Delta variant, it is highly transmissible and can outcompete the Delta variant under immune selection pressure.

The same three positions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) are affected in both variants, but where the 417 substitution differs, the E484K/N501Y have co-evolved by convergent evolution. Here we characterize the functional and immune evasive consequences of the P.1 and B.1.351 RBD mutations. E484K and N501Y result in gain-of-function with two different outcomes: The N501Y confers a ten-fold affinity increase towards ACE-2, but a modest antibody evasion potential of plasma from convalescent or vaccinated individuals, whereas the E484K displays a significant antibody evasion capacity without a major impact on affinity. On the other hand, the two different 417 substitutions severely impair the RBD/ACE-2 affinity, but in the combined P.1 and B.1.351 RBD variants, this effect is partly counterbalanced by the effect of the E484K and N501Y.

With the global transmission of the virus, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have also appeared, especially, emerging strains that have recently been discovered in the United Kingdom (variant 20I/501Y.V1, lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (variant 20H/501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351), and Brazil (variant 20 J/501Y.V3, and lineage P.1). The common feature of these variants is that they share the N501Y mutation involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which is precisely the target of most COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, mutations such as N501Y, E484K, and K417N in the S protein may affect viral fitness and transmissibility. However, current research on the impact of these variants on COVID-19 vaccines is still lacking. Herein, we briefly explain why most COVID-19 vaccines target the S protein, update the progress of research regarding S protein-related COVID-19 vaccines, review the latest studies concerning the effects of S protein variants on COVID-19 vaccines, and finally, propose certain strategies to deal with SARS-CoV-2 variants.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines | level: undefined

With the global transmission of the virus, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have also appeared, especially, emerging strains that have recently been discovered in the United Kingdom (variant 20I/501Y.V1, lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (variant 20H/501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351), and Brazil (variant 20 J/501Y.V3, and lineage P.1). The common feature of these variants is that they share the N501Y mutation involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which is precisely the target of most COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, mutations such as N501Y, E484K, and K417N in the S protein may affect viral fitness and transmissibility. However, current research on the impact of these variants on COVID-19 vaccines is still lacking.

360	10.1101/2021.08.14.21262020	Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2), initially identified in India, has become predominant in several countries, including Portugal. Few studies have compared the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against Delta versus Alpha variant of concern (VOC) and estimated variant-specific viral loads in vaccine infection breakthroughs cases. In the context of Delta dominance, this information is critical to inform decision-makers regarding the planning of restrictions and vaccination roll-out. Methods: We developed a case-case study to compare mRNA vaccines' effectiveness against Delta (B.1.617.2) versus Alpha (B.1.1.7) variants. We used RT-PCR positive cases notified to the National Surveillance System between 17th of May and 4th of July 2021 (week 20 to 26) and information about demographics and vaccination status through the electronic vaccination register. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or spike (S) gene target failure (SGTF) data were used to classify SARS-CoV-2 variants. The odds of vaccinated individuals to become infected (odds of vaccine infection breakthrough) in Delta cases compared to Alpha SARS-CoV-2 cases was estimated by conditional logistic regression adjusted for age group, sex, and matched by the week of diagnosis. As a surrogate of viral load, mean RT-PCR Ct values were stratified and compared between vaccine status and VOC. Results: Of the 2 097 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases included in the analysis, 966 (46.1%) were classified with WGS and 1131 (53.9%) with SGTF. Individuals infected with the Delta variant were more frequently vaccinated 162 (12%) than individuals infected with the Alpha variant 38 (5%). We report a statistically significant higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough for partial (OR=1.70; CI95% 1.18 to 2.47) and complete vaccination (OR=1.96; CI95% 1.22 to 3.14) in the Delta cases when compared to the Alpha cases, suggesting lower mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Delta cases. On our secondary analysis, we observed lower mean Ct values for the Delta VOC cases versus Alpha, regardless the vaccination status. Additionally, the Delta variant cases revealed a Ct-value mean increase of 2.24 (CI95% 0.85 to 3.64) between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated breakthrough cases contrasting with 4.49 (CI95% 2.07 to 6.91) in the Alpha VOC, suggesting a lower impact of vaccine on viral load of Delta cases. Conclusions: We found significantly higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough in Delta cases when compared to Alpha cases, suggesting lower effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in preventing infection with the Delta variant. Additionally, the vaccine breakthrough cases are estimated to be of higher mean Ct values, suggesting higher infectiousness with the Delta variant infection. These findings can help decision-makers weigh on the application or lifting of control measures and adjusting vaccine roll-out depending on the predominance of the Delta variant and the coverage of partial and complete mRNA vaccination.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: ct_value | level: lower

AIM: We evaluated transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the Delta variant in an outbreak in southern China. METHODS: Data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts were retrospectively collected from the outbreak that occurred in Guangdong, China in May and June 2021. Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. RESULTS: We identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. Mean estimates of latent and incubation period were 3.9 days and 5.8 days, respectively. Relatively higher viral load was observed in infections with Delta than in infections with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Secondary attack rate among close contacts of cases with Delta was 1.4%, and 73.1% (95% credible interval (CrI): 32.9–91.4) of the transmissions occurred before onset. Index cases without vaccination (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.84; 95% CI: 1.19–8.45) or with an incomplete vaccination series (aOR: 6.02; 95% CI: 2.45–18.16) were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received the complete primary vaccination series. DISCUSSION: Patients infected with the Delta variant had more rapid symptom onset compared with the wild type. The time-varying serial interval should be accounted for in estimation of reproduction numbers. The higher viral load and higher risk of pre-symptomatic transmission indicated the challenges in control of infections with the Delta variant.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: viral_load | level: higher

367	10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.10.019	Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have repeatedly altered the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delta variants of concern are now the focus of intense international attention because they are causing widespread COVID-19 disease globally and are associated with vaccine breakthrough cases. We sequenced the genomes of 16,965 SARS-CoV-2 from samples acquired March 15, 2021 through September 20, 2021 in the Houston Methodist hospital system. This sample represents 91% of all Methodist system COVID-19 patients during the study period. Delta variants increased rapidly from late April onward to cause 99.9% of all COVID-19 cases and spread throughout the Houston metroplex. Compared to all other variants combined, Delta caused a significantly higher rate of vaccine breakthrough cases (23.7% for Delta compared to 6.6% for all other variants combined). Importantly, significantly fewer fully vaccinated individuals required hospitalization. Individuals with vaccine breakthrough cases caused by Delta had a low median PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value (a proxy for high virus load). This value was closely similar to the median Ct value for unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 caused by Delta variants, suggesting that fully vaccinated individuals can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. Patients infected with Alpha and Delta variants had several significant differences. Our integrated analysis emphasizes that vaccines used in the United States are highly effective in decreasing severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalizations, and deaths.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines | level: lower

369	10.1093/cid/ciab721	BACKGROUND: he impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) on disease severity is unclear. In this retrospective study, we compared outcomes of patients infected with B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 with those with wild-type strains from early 2020. METHODS: National surveillance data from 1-January-2021 to 22-May-2021 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, and outcomes in relation to VOC were explored. Detailed patient level data from all patients with VOC infection admitted to our center between 20-December-2020 and 12-May-2021 were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were compared with a cohort of 846 patients admitted from January-April 2020. RESULTS: 829 patients in Singapore in the study period were infected with these 3 VOCs. After adjusting for age and sex, B.1.617.2 was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or death (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.90, [95% CI 1.43-30.78]). 157 of these patients were admitted to our center. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and vaccination, aOR for pneumonia with B.1.617.2 was 1.88 [95% CI 0.95-3.76]) compared with wild-type. These differences were not seen with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Vaccination status was associated with decreased severity. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and longer duration of Ct value ≤30 (median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2, 13 days for wild-type). CONCLUSIONS: There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility. These findings provide an impetus for the rapid implementation of vaccination programs.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: disease_severity | level: higher

These differences were not seen with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Vaccination status was associated with decreased severity. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and longer duration of Ct value ≤30 (median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2, 13 days for wild-type). CONCLUSIONS: There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility. These findings provide an impetus for the rapid implementation of vaccination programs.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher
373	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.12.326	Objectives This study aims to explore the association between the molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and disease severity on ambulatory and hospitalized patients in two main Colombian epicenters during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We included 1000 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected clinical data from 997, and obtained 678 whole genome sequences by massively parallel sequencing. Bivariate, multivariate, and classification and regression tree analyses were run between clinical and genomic variables. Results Age and infection with lineages B.1.1, B.1.1.388, B.1.523, and B.1.621 were related to lethality for patients 71-88 years old (OR: 6.048036; 95% CI 1.346567-32.92521, p-value: 0.01718674). The need for hospitalization was associated with higher age and comorbidities. For patients 38-51 years old infected with lineages A, B, B.1.1.388, B.1.1.434, B.1.153, B.1.36.10, B.1.411, B.1.471, B.1.558 or B.1.621, hospitalization rate increased significantly (OR 8.368427, 95% CI 2.573145-39.10672, p-value: 0.00012). Associations between clades and clinical outcomes diverged from previously reported data. Conclusions Lineage B.1.621 increased the need for hospitalization and lethality. Our findings, plus the rapidly increasing prevalence in Colombia and other countries, suggest broadly considering it as a Variant of Interest. If associated disease severity is confirmed, possible designation as Variant of Concern could be entertained.	mutation_name: B.1.1 | effect: fatality_rate | level: higher

375	10.1016/j.meegid.2021.105092	OBJECTIVES: To compare the demographics, clinical characteristics and severity of patients infected with nine different SARS-CoV-2 variants, during three phases of the COVID-19 epidemic in Marseille. METHODS: A single centre retrospective cohort study was conducted in 1760 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of Nextstrain clades 20A, 20B, and 20C (first phase, February–May 2020), Pangolin lineages B.1.177 (we named Marseille-2) and B.1.160 (Marseille-4) variants (second phase, June–December 2020), and B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and A.27 (Marseille-501) variants (third phase, January 2021-today). Outcomes were the occurrence of clinical failures, including hospitalisation, transfer to the intensive-care unit, and death. RESULTS: During each phase, no major differences were observed with regards to age and gender distribution, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and clinical symptoms between variants circulating in a given phase. The B.1.177 and B.1.160 variants were associated with more severe outcomes. Infections occurring during the second phase were associated with a higher rate of death as compared to infections during the first and third phases. Patients in the second phase were more likely to be hospitalised than those in the third phase. Patients infected during the third phase were more frequently obese than others. CONCLUSION: A large cohort study is recommended to evaluate the transmissibility and to better characterise the clinical severity of emerging variants.	mutation_name: B.1.177 | effect: disease_severity | level: higher

METHODS: A single centre retrospective cohort study was conducted in 1760 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of Nextstrain clades 20A, 20B, and 20C (first phase, February–May 2020), Pangolin lineages B.1.177 (we named Marseille-2) and B.1.160 (Marseille-4) variants (second phase, June–December 2020), and B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and A.27 (Marseille-501) variants (third phase, January 2021-today). Outcomes were the occurrence of clinical failures, including hospitalisation, transfer to the intensive-care unit, and death. RESULTS: During each phase, no major differences were observed with regards to age and gender distribution, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and clinical symptoms between variants circulating in a given phase. The B.1.177 and B.1.160 variants were associated with more severe outcomes.

378	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.08.003	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate changes in COVID-19 patients' characteristics occurring after the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) P.1 (Gamma) by comparing the clinical, demographic and laboratory profile of patients hospitalized during the first (May-July 2020) and second (December 2020 - February 2021) pandemic waves. METHODS: Data was collected from records of COVID-19 patients (n=4164) admitted to a single hospital in Salvador, Northeast Brazil. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was performed in nasopharyngeal swab samples from 12 patients with age < 60 years-old admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) in February 2021. RESULTS: From June 2020 to February 2021, the median age of patients admitted in the ICU decreased from 66 to 58 years (p<0.05), accompanied by an increased proportion of patients without comorbidities (15.32% vs 32.20%, p<0.0001). A significant reduction in the Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests was observed in the second wave (p<0.0001). Sequencing analysis detected lineage Gamma in all 12 ICU patients sampled in February 2021. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated an increased proportion of younger adults without comorbidities with severe disease during the second COVID-19 wave, shortly after the confirmation of local Gamma circulation.	mutation_name: P.1 | effect: disease_severity | level: higher

We aimed to describe the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC), including virological characteristics and clinical severity in contemporaneous patients with and without the variant. METHODS: In this cohort study, samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR that were collected from Nov 9, 2020, for patients acutely admitted to one of two hospitals on or before Dec 20, 2020, in London, UK, were sequenced and analysed for the presence of VOC-defining mutations. We fitted Poisson regression models to investigate the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease (defined as point 6 or higher on the WHO ordinal scale within 14 days of symptoms or positive test) and death within 28 days of a positive test and did supplementary genomic analyses in a cohort of chronically shedding patients and in a cohort of remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load was compared by proxy, using PCR cycle threshold values and sequencing read depths. FINDINGS: Of 496 patients with samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR and who met inclusion criteria, 341 had samples that could be sequenced. 198 (58%) of 341 had B.1.1.7 infection and 143 (42%) had non-B.1.1.7 infection. We found no evidence of an association between severe disease and death and lineage (B.1.1.7 vs non-B.1.1.7) in unadjusted analyses (prevalence ratio [PR] 0·97 [95% CI 0·72–1·31]), or in analyses adjusted for hospital, sex, age, comorbidities, and ethnicity (adjusted PR 1·02 [0·76–1·38]). We detected no B.1.1.7 VOC-defining mutations in 123 chronically shedding immunocompromised patients or in 32 remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load by proxy was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold value (mean 28·8 [SD 4·7] vs 32·0 [4·8]; p=0·0085) and genomic read depth (1280 [1004] vs 831 [682]; p=0·0011). INTERPRETATION: Emerging evidence exists of increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7, and we found increased virus load by proxy for B.1.1.7 in our data.

In this study we evaluated if commercially available quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay can identify SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage samples by a specific N gene dropout or Ct value shift compared to the S or RdRp gene. METHODS: VOC B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2-positive patient samples were identified via whole-genome sequencing and variant-specific PCR. Confirmed B.1.1.7 (n=48) and non-B.1.1.7 samples (n=58) were analysed using the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV™ PCR assay for presence of SARS-CoV-2 S, RdRp and N gene. N gene coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with and without D3L mutation (specific for B.1.1.7) was cloned into pCR®-TOPO vectors to validate polymorphism dependent N gene dropout with Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV™ PCR assay. RESULTS: All studied B.1.1.7-positive patient samples showed significantly higher Ct values in qRT-PCR (Δ 6-10, N gene dropout on Ct values >29) of N gene compared to the corresponding values of S (p ≤ 0.0001) and RdRp (p ≤ 0.0001) genes. The assay reliably discriminated B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 positive samples (area under the curve AUC = 1) in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Identical Ct shifts (Δ 7-10) were detected in reverse genetic experiments, using isolated plasmids containing N gene coding sequences corresponding to D3 or 3L variants. CONCLUSIONS: A N gene dropout or Ct value shift is shown for B.1.1.7-positive samples in the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV PCR assay. This approach can be used as a rapid tool for B.1.1.7 detection in single assay high throughput diagnostics.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: ct_value | level: higher

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor protein that interacts with the spike glycoprotein of the host to facilitate the entry of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) hence causing the disease (COVID-19). Our experimental design is based on bioinformatics approach that combines sequence, structure and consensus based tools to label a protein coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as damaging/deleterious or neutral. The interaction of wildtype ACE2-spike glycoprotein and their variants were analyzed using docking studies. The mutations W461R, G405E and F588S in ACE2 receptor protein and population specific mutations P391S, C12S and G1223A in the spike glycoprotein were predicted as highly destabilizing to the structure of the bound complex. So far, no extensive in silico study has been reported that identifies the effect of SNPs on Spike glycoprotein-ACE2 interaction exploring both sequence and structural features. To this end, this study conducted an in-depth analysis that facilitates in identifying the mutations that blocks the interaction of two proteins that can result in stopping the virus from entering the host cell.

390	10.1080/07391102.2020.1823885	COVID-19 an outbreak of a novel corona virus originating from Wuhan, China in December 2019 has now spread across the entire world and has been declared a pandemic by WHO. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor protein that interacts with the spike glycoprotein of the host to facilitate the entry of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) hence causing the disease (COVID-19). Our experimental design is based on bioinformatics approach that combines sequence, structure and consensus based tools to label a protein coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as damaging/deleterious or neutral. The interaction of wildtype ACE2-spike glycoprotein and their variants were analyzed using docking studies. The mutations W461R, G405E and F588S in ACE2 receptor protein and population specific mutations P391S, C12S and G1223A in the spike glycoprotein were predicted as highly destabilizing to the structure of the bound complex. So far, no extensive in silico study has been reported that identifies the effect of SNPs on Spike glycoprotein-ACE2 interaction exploring both sequence and structural features. To this end, this study conducted an in-depth analysis that facilitates in identifying the mutations that blocks the interaction of two proteins that can result in stopping the virus from entering the host cell.

391	10.3389/fmolb.2021.614443	The emergence of novel coronavirus mutants is a main factor behind the deterioration of the epidemic situation. Further studies into the pathogenicity of these mutants are thus urgently needed. Binding of the spinous protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor was shown to initiate coronavirus entry into host cells and lead to their infection. The receptor-binding motif (RBM, 438–506) is a region that directly interacts with ACE2 receptor in the RBD and plays a crucial role in determining affinity. To unravel how mutations in the non-RBM regions impact the interaction between RBD and ACE2, we selected three non-RBM mutant systems (N354D, D364Y, and V367F) from the documented clinical cases, and the Q498A mutant system located in the RBM region served as the control. Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted on the mutant systems and the wild-type (WT) system, and verified experiments also performed. Non-RBM mutations have been shown not only to change conformation of the RBM region but also to significantly influence its hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In particular, the D364Y and V367F systems showed a higher affinity for ACE2 owing to their electrostatic interactions and polar solvation energy changes. In addition, although the binding free energy at this point increased after the mutation of N354D, the conformation of the random coil (Pro384-Asp389) was looser than that of other systems, and the combined effect weakened the binding free energy between RBD and ACE2. Interestingly, we also found a random coil (Ala475-Gly485). This random coil is very sensitive to mutations, and both types of mutations increase the binding free energy of residues in this region. We found that the binding loop (Tyr495-Tyr505) in the RBD domain strongly binds to Lys353, an important residue of the ACE2 domain previously identified. The binding free energy of the non-RBM mutant group at the binding loop had positive and negative changes, and these changes were more obvious than that of the Q498A system. The results of this study elucidate the effect of non-RBM mutation on ACE2-RBD binding, and provide new insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutation research.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D364Y | effect: protein_conformational_optimization | level: no evidence

400	10.1128/msystems.00030-21	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in 92 million cases in a span of 1 year. The study focuses on understanding population-specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions particularly in the United States. Rigorous phylogenomic network analysis of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (245) inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d, and e (subtypes e1 and e2). Clade d and subclade e2 were found exclusively comprised of U.S. strains. Clades were distinguished by 10 co-mutational combinations in Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2, and Nsp6. Our analysis revealed that only 67.46% of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations were at the amino acid level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase protein stability in 238 strains except for 6 strains which were marked as ancestral type, whereas co-mutation (P409L and Y446C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes from the United States highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking highlighted mutation (D614G) caused reduction in binding of spike proteins with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but it also showed better interaction with the TMPRSS2 receptor contributing to high transmissibility among U.S. strains. We also found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B, and MYO5C, that had maximum interaction with viral proteins (nucleocapsid [N], spike [S], and membrane [M] proteins). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO5 proteins which could be an effective target for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. The functional annotations of the host-pathogen interaction (HPI) network were found to be closely associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions, confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection. We also screened CpG islands in Nsp1 and N conferring the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger zinc antiviral protein (ZAP) activity inside the host cell. IMPORTANCE In the current study, we presented a global view of mutational pattern observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. This provided a who-infect-whom geographical model since the early pandemic. This is hitherto the most comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of full-length genomes for co-mutations at different geographical regions especially in U.S. strains. Compositional structural biology results suggested that mutations have a balance of opposing forces affecting pathogenicity suggesting that only a few mutations are effective at the translation level. Novel HPI analysis and CpG predictions elucidate the proof of concept of hypoxia and thrombotic conditions in several patients. Thus, the current study focuses the understanding of population-specific variations attributing a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in specific geographical regions which may eventually be vital for the most severely affected countries and regions for sharp development of custom-made vindication strategies.	mutation_name: NSP3_T1103P | effect: protein_stability | level: higher

The functional annotations of the host-pathogen interaction (HPI) network were found to be closely associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions, confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection. We also screened CpG islands in Nsp1 and N conferring the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger zinc antiviral protein (ZAP) activity inside the host cell. IMPORTANCE In the current study, we presented a global view of mutational pattern observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. This provided a who-infect-whom geographical model since the early pandemic. This is hitherto the most comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of full-length genomes for co-mutations at different geographical regions especially in U.S. strains. Compositional structural biology results suggested that mutations have a balance of opposing forces affecting pathogenicity suggesting that only a few mutations are effective at the translation level. Novel HPI analysis and CpG predictions elucidate the proof of concept of hypoxia and thrombotic conditions in several patients. Thus, the current study focuses the understanding of population-specific variations attributing a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in specific geographical regions which may eventually be vital for the most severely affected countries and regions for sharp development of custom-made vindication strategies.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: lower
402	10.1128/msystems.00030-21	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in 92 million cases in a span of 1 year. The study focuses on understanding population-specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions particularly in the United States. Rigorous phylogenomic network analysis of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (245) inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d, and e (subtypes e1 and e2). Clade d and subclade e2 were found exclusively comprised of U.S. strains. Clades were distinguished by 10 co-mutational combinations in Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2, and Nsp6. Our analysis revealed that only 67.46% of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations were at the amino acid level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase protein stability in 238 strains except for 6 strains which were marked as ancestral type, whereas co-mutation (P409L and Y446C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes from the United States highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking highlighted mutation (D614G) caused reduction in binding of spike proteins with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but it also showed better interaction with the TMPRSS2 receptor contributing to high transmissibility among U.S. strains. We also found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B, and MYO5C, that had maximum interaction with viral proteins (nucleocapsid [N], spike [S], and membrane [M] proteins).

In this study, we tested a panel of anti-receptor-binding domain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) corresponding to those in clinical use by Vir Biotechnology (S309, the parent mAb of VIR-7831 (sotrovimab)), AstraZeneca (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, the parent mAbs of AZD8895 and AZD1061), Regeneron (REGN10933 and REGN10987), Eli Lilly (LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016) and Celltrion (CT-P59) for their ability to neutralize an infectious B.1.1.529 Omicron isolate. Several mAbs (LY-CoV555, LY-CoV016, REGN10933, REGN10987 and CT-P59) completely lost neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529 virus in both Vero-TMPRSS2 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, whereas others were reduced (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 combination, ~12-fold decrease) or minimally affected (S309).

407	10.3389/fcimb.2021.753249	BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is evolving continuously with emergence of several variants of increasing transmission capabilities and pandemic potential. Generation of variants occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature of viral genome, which is further enhanced by variable selection pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without mild gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic symptoms. However, the virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation, infection in various organs, and host response to emerging variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation. Several studies have reported underlying diseases including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders, and immunocompromised conditions as significant risk factors for severe form of COVID-19. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are also highly predominant in the population, which can alter COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response. We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases. METHODS: In this review, we have elucidated the emergence and characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants, mechanisms of infection and host immune response, GI and hepatic manifestation with radiologic features of COVID-19, and outcomes in pre-existing liver and GI diseases. KEY FINDINGS: Emerging variants of concern (VOC) have shown increased transmissibility and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality. There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including alpha (B.1.1.7, UK), beta (B.1.351, South Africa), gamma (B.1.1.28.1, Brazil), and delta (B1.1.617, India) variants. The mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for increased receptor binding (N501Y, P681R) and immune escape (L452R, E484K/Q, T478K/R) to host response. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease TMPRSS2, which is required for both spike protein binding and cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of SARS-CoV2 are less severe, the detection of virus in patient’s stool indicates GI tropism, replication, and shedding from the GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury, acute hepatic decompensation, and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure may change the disease outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the spike protein of emerging variants, immunomodulation by viral proteins, and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N501Y | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

Generation of variants occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature of viral genome, which is further enhanced by variable selection pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without mild gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic symptoms. However, the virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation, infection in various organs, and host response to emerging variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation. Several studies have reported underlying diseases including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders, and immunocompromised conditions as significant risk factors for severe form of COVID-19. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are also highly predominant in the population, which can alter COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response. We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases. METHODS: In this review, we have elucidated the emergence and characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants, mechanisms of infection and host immune response, GI and hepatic manifestation with radiologic features of COVID-19, and outcomes in pre-existing liver and GI diseases. KEY FINDINGS: Emerging variants of concern (VOC) have shown increased transmissibility and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality. There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including alpha (B.1.1.7, UK), beta (B.1.351, South Africa), gamma (B.1.1.28.1, Brazil), and delta (B1.1.617, India) variants. The mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for increased receptor binding (N501Y, P681R) and immune escape (L452R, E484K/Q, T478K/R) to host response. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease TMPRSS2, which is required for both spike protein binding and cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of SARS-CoV2 are less severe, the detection of virus in patient’s stool indicates GI tropism, replication, and shedding from the GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury, acute hepatic decompensation, and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure may change the disease outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the spike protein of emerging variants, immunomodulation by viral proteins, and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

METHODS: In this review, we have elucidated the emergence and characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants, mechanisms of infection and host immune response, GI and hepatic manifestation with radiologic features of COVID-19, and outcomes in pre-existing liver and GI diseases. KEY FINDINGS: Emerging variants of concern (VOC) have shown increased transmissibility and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality. There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including alpha (B.1.1.7, UK), beta (B.1.351, South Africa), gamma (B.1.1.28.1, Brazil), and delta (B1.1.617, India) variants. The mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for increased receptor binding (N501Y, P681R) and immune escape (L452R, E484K/Q, T478K/R) to host response. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease TMPRSS2, which is required for both spike protein binding and cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of SARS-CoV2 are less severe, the detection of virus in patient’s stool indicates GI tropism, replication, and shedding from the GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury, acute hepatic decompensation, and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure may change the disease outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the spike protein of emerging variants, immunomodulation by viral proteins, and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.	mutation_name: B.1.1.617 | effect: fatality_rate | level: higher

To date, there have been described three lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating worldwide, two of them are found among Mexican population, within these, we observed three mutations of spike (S) protein located at amino acids H49Y, D614G, and T573I. To understand if these mutations could affect the structural behavior of S protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the binding with S protein inhibitors (cepharanthine, nelfinavir, and hydroxychloroquine), molecular dynamic simulations and molecular docking were employed. It was found that these punctual mutations affect considerably the structural behavior of the S protein compared to wild type, which also affect the binding of its inhibitors into their respective binding site. Thus, further experimental studies are needed to explore if these affectations have an impact on drug-S protein binding and its possible clinical effect.	mutation_name: SPIKE_H49Y | effect: protein_functioning | level: lower

415	10.1371/journal.ppat.1010053	COVID-19 patients transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to minks in the Netherlands in April 2020. Subsequently, the mink-associated virus (miSARS-CoV-2) spilled back over into humans. Genetic sequences of the miSARS-CoV-2 identified a new genetic variant known as “Cluster 5” that contained mutations in the spike protein. However, the functional properties of these “Cluster 5” mutations have not been well established. In this study, we found that the Y453F mutation located in the RBD domain of miSARS-CoV-2 is an adaptive mutation that enhances binding to mink ACE2 and other orthologs of Mustela species without compromising, and even enhancing, its ability to utilize human ACE2 as a receptor for entry. Structural analysis suggested that despite the similarity in the overall binding mode of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human and mink ACE2, Y34 of mink ACE2 was better suited to interact with a Phe rather than a Tyr at position 453 of the viral RBD due to less steric clash and tighter hydrophobic-driven interaction. Additionally, the Y453F spike exhibited resistance to convalescent serum, posing a risk for vaccine development. Thus, our study suggests that since the initial transmission from humans, SARS-CoV-2 evolved to adapt to the mink host, leading to widespread circulation among minks while still retaining its ability to efficiently utilize human ACE2 for entry, thus allowing for transmission of the miSARS-CoV-2 back into humans. These findings underscore the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Mustela species and other susceptible hosts in order to prevent future outbreaks.	mutation_name: SPIKE_Y453F | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

Recently, several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants. Several antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2. Several clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the B.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine, known as anesthetic at high doses, and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudoviruses with common receptor binding domain mutations, N501Y, K417N, and E484K, as well as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2.

The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the B.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine, known as anesthetic at high doses, and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudoviruses with common receptor binding domain mutations, N501Y, K417N, and E484K, as well as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2. Our study confirms previous data and extends information on the repurposing of these drugs to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection including different variants of concern, however, extensive clinical studies must be performed to confirm our in vitro findings.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: unaffected

422	10.1080/07391102.2022.2032354	The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus-2 (SARS CoV-2) infection has resulted in the current global pandemic. The binding of SARS CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor causes the host infection. The spike protein has undergone several mutations with reference to the initial strain isolated during December 2019 from Wuhan, China. A number of these mutant strains have been reported as variants of concern and as variants being monitored. Some of these mutants are known to be responsible for increased transmissibility of the virus. The reason for the increased transmissibility caused by the point mutations can be understood by studying the structural implications and inter-molecular interactions in the binding of viral spike protein RBD and human ACE-2. Here, we use the crystal structure of the RBD in complex with ACE-2 available in the public domain and analyse the 250 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of wild-type and mutants; K417N, K417T, N440K, N501Y, L452R, T478K, E484K and S494P. The ionic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions, amino acid residue flexibility, binding energies and structural variations are characterized. The MD simulations provide clues to the molecular mechanisms of ACE-2 receptor binding in wild-type and mutant complexes.

423	10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101773	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world jeopardizing the global economy and health. The rapid proliferation and infectivity of the virus can be attributed to many accumulating mutations in the spike protein leading to continuous generation of variants. The spike protein is a glycoprotein that recognizes and binds to cell surface receptor known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) leading to the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes and entry into the host cells. These circulating variants in the population have greatly impacted the virulence, transmissibility, and immunological evasion of the host. The present study is aimed at understanding the impact of the major mutations (L452R, T478K and N501Y) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and their consequences on the binding affinity to human ACE2 through protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. Protein-protein docking and Molecular mechanics with generalised Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) binding free energy analysis reveal that the spike mutants-L452R, T478K and N501Y have a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 as compared to the native spike protein. The increase in the number of interface residues, interface area and intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and non-bonded contacts corroborated with the increase in the binding affinity of the spike mutants to ACE2. Further, 75 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulation investigations show variations in the geometric properties such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), total solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and number of hydrogen bonds (NHBs) in the mutant spike:ACE2 complexes with respect to the native spike:ACE2 complex. Therefore, the findings of this study unravel plausible molecular mechanisms of increase in binding affinity of spike mutants (L452R, T478K and N501Y) to human ACE2 leading to higher virulence and infectivity of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The study will further aid in designing novel therapeutics targeting the interface residues between spike protein and ACE2 receptor.	mutation_name: SPIKE_L452R | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

The present study is aimed at understanding the impact of the major mutations (L452R, T478K and N501Y) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and their consequences on the binding affinity to human ACE2 through protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. Protein-protein docking and Molecular mechanics with generalised Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) binding free energy analysis reveal that the spike mutants-L452R, T478K and N501Y have a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 as compared to the native spike protein. The increase in the number of interface residues, interface area and intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and non-bonded contacts corroborated with the increase in the binding affinity of the spike mutants to ACE2. Further, 75 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulation investigations show variations in the geometric properties such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), total solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and number of hydrogen bonds (NHBs) in the mutant spike:ACE2 complexes with respect to the native spike:ACE2 complex. Therefore, the findings of this study unravel plausible molecular mechanisms of increase in binding affinity of spike mutants (L452R, T478K and N501Y) to human ACE2 leading to higher virulence and infectivity of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The study will further aid in designing novel therapeutics targeting the interface residues between spike protein and ACE2 receptor.	mutation_name: SPIKE_L452R | effect: protein_conformational_optimization | level: no evidence

428	10.1016/j.medidd.2021.100086	SARS-CoV-2 is a global challenge due to its ability to spread much faster than the SARS-CoV, which was attributed to the mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD). These mutations enhanced the electrostatic interactions. Recently, a new strain is reported in the UK that includes a mutation (N501Y) in the RBD, that is possibly increasing the infection rate. Here, using Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, we show that the N501 mutation enhanced the electrostatic interactions due to the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between SARS-CoV-2-T500 and ACE2-D355 near the mutation site. In addition, we observed that the electrostatic interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the wild type and the mutant are dominated by salt-bridges formed between SARS-CoV-2-K417 and ACE2-D30, SARS-CoV-2-K458, ACE2-E23, and SARS-CoV-2-R403 and ACE2-E37.

The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.	mutation_name: SPIKE_G476S | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: lower

Keeping in view the importance of the hot spot residue 501, we predicted the potentially emerging structural variants of 501 residue. We analyzed the binding pattern of wild type and mutants (Spike RBD) to the ACE2 receptor by deciphering variations in the amino acids’ interaction networks by graph kernels along with evolutionary, network metrics, and energetic information. Our analysis revealed that N501I, N501T, and N501V increase the binding affinity and alter the intra and inter-residue bonding networks. The N501T has shown strong positive selection and fitness in other animals.

Here, we decode the effect of these two mutations on the host receptor, ACE2, and neutralizing antibody (B38) recognition. The N501Y RBD mutant binds to ACE2 with higher affinity due to improved π-π stacking and π-cation interactions. The higher binding affinity of the E484K mutant is caused due to the formation of additional hydrogen bond and salt-bridge interactions with ACE2.

Though vaccines are available, the virus is mutating to form new strains among which are the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 that demonstrate increased transmissivity and infectivity. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore the role of the mutations in the interaction of the virus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with the host receptor ACE2. We find that the hydrogen bond networks are rearranged in the variants and also that new hydrogen bonds are established between the RBD and ACE2 as a result of mutations. We investigated three variants: the wild-type (WT), B.1.1.7, and B.1.351. We find that the B.1.351 variant (also known as 501Y.V2) shows larger flexibility in the RBD loop segment involving residue K484, yet the RBD–ACE2 complex shows higher stability. Mutations that allow a more flexible interface that can result in a more stable complex may be a factor contributing to the increased infectivity of the mutated variants.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

Although environmental, demographic and co-morbidity factors have an impact on the severity of the disease, contribution of the mutations in each of the viral genes towards the degree of severity needs a deeper understanding for designing a better therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Open Reading Frame-3a (ORF3a) protein has been found to be mutated at several positions. In this work, we have studied the effect of one of the most frequently occurring mutants, D155Y of ORF3a protein, found in Indian COVID-19 patients. Using computational simulations we demonstrated that the substitution at 155th changed the amino acids involved in salt bridge formation, hydrogen-bond occupancy, interactome clusters, and the stability of the protein compared with the other substitutions found in Indian patients. Protein–protein docking using HADDOCK analysis revealed that substitution D155Y weakened the binding affinity of ORF3a with caveolin-1 compared with the other substitutions, suggesting its importance in the overall stability of ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex, which may modulate the virulence property of SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name: ORF3A_D155Y | effect: intermolecular_interactions | level: no evidence

It was observed that the B.1.1.7 variant required a longer maturation time. The transcriptional response demonstrated higher expression of ORF6 and ORF8 compared to nucleocapsid transcript till the eclipse period which might influence higher viral replication. The number of infectious viruses titer is higher in the B.1.1.7, despite a lesser copy number than B.1, indicating higher transmissibility.

The experimental evidence published linked ORF6 and ORF8 to play important role in replication and we also observed their higher expression. This leads us to hypothesis the possible role of ORF6 and ORF8 in B.1.1.7 higher replication which causes higher transmission.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_replication | level: higher
464	10.1126/science.abg5827	There is an urgent need for antiviral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs against OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common cold and evaluated the top hits against SARS-CoV-2. Twenty drugs significantly inhibited replication of both viruses in vitro. Eight of these drugs inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro, with the most potent being masitinib, an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor. X-ray crystallography and biochemistry show that masitinib acts as a competitive inhibitor of 3CLpro. Mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then treated with masitinib showed >200-fold reduction in viral titers in the lungs and nose, as well as reduced lung inflammation. Masitinib was also effective in vitro against all tested variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1).	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: unaffected

465	10.1038/s41467-021-24339-7	The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines. Recently, viral mutants termed variants of concern (VOC) which may escape host immunity have emerged. The efficacy of spike encoding mRNA vaccines (CVnCoV and CV2CoV) against the ancestral strain and the VOC B.1.351 was tested in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with a formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice develop elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody and neutralization titers which are readily detectable, but significantly reduced against VOC B.1.351. The mRNA vaccines fully protect from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. SARS-CoV-2 remains undetected in swabs, lung, or brain in these groups. Despite lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to the ancestral strain BavPat1, CVnCoV and CV2CoV show complete disease protection against the novel VOC B.1.351 in our studies.	mutation_name: B.1.351 | effect: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines | level: unaffected
466	10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102715	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly evolving in the form of new variants. At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (≥20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (≥20 %) than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.	mutation_name: AY.1 | effect: binding_to_antibodies | level: lower

468	10.1101/2021.02.14.431043	Wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is critical to tracking viral evolution during the ongoing pandemic. Variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil have spread to multiple countries. We developed the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detected an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020 when it represented <1% of sequenced coronavirus genomes that were collected in New York City (NYC). By February 2021, genomes from this lineage accounted for ~32% of 3288 sequenced genomes from NYC specimens. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage in NYC, notably the sub-clade defined by the spike mutation E484K, which has outpaced the growth of other variants in NYC. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, indicating the public health importance of this lineage.	mutation_name: B.1.526 | effect: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera | level: lower

471	10.1101/2021.06.16.21259017	Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean, has had a unique experience of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In March 2020, Mauritius endured a small first wave and quickly implemented control measures which allowed elimination of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. When borders to the island reopened, it was accompanied by mandatory quarantine and testing of incoming passengers to avoid reintroduction of the virus into the community. As variants of concern (VOCs) emerged elsewhere in the world, Mauritius began using genomic surveillance to keep track of quarantined cases of these variants. In March 2021, another local outbreak occurred, and sequencing was used to investigate this new wave of local infections. Here, we analyze 154 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Mauritius, which represent 12% of all the infections seem in Mauritius, these were both from specimens of incoming passengers before March 2021 and those of cases during the second wave. Our findings indicate that despite the presence of known VOCs Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) among quarantined passengers, the second wave of local SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mauritius was caused by a single introduction and dominant circulation of the B.1.1.318 virus. The B.1.1.318 variant is characterized by fourteen non-synonymous mutations in the S-gene, with five encoded amino acid substitutions (T95I, E484K, D614G, P681H, D796H) and one deletion (Y144del) in the Spike glycoprotein. This variant seems to be increasing in prevalence and it is now present in 34 countries. This study highlights that despite having stopped the introduction of more transmissible VOCs by travel quarantines, a single undetected introduction of a B.1.1.318 lineage virus was enough to initiate a large local outbreak in Mauritius and demonstrated the need for continuous genomic surveillance to fully inform public health decisions.	mutation_name: B.1.1.318 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in ≥0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in ≥0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.	mutation_name: NSP12_P323L | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: unaffected
475	10.1101/2021.03.09.21253242	Previous work has shown that environment affects SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but it is unclear whether emerging strains show similar responses. Here we show that lineage B.1.1.7 spread with greater transmission in colder and more densely populated parts of England. We also find evidence of B.1.1.7's transmission advantage at warmer temperatures versus other strains, implying that spring conditions may facilitate B.1.1.7's invasion in Europe and across the Northern hemisphere, undermining the effectiveness of public health interventions.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher
476	10.1101/2021.06.04.21258333	In early 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 became dominant across large parts of the world. In Denmark, comprehensive and real-time test, contact-tracing, and sequencing efforts were applied to sustain epidemic control. Here, we use these data to investigate the transmissibility, introduction, and onward transmission of B.1.1.7 in Denmark. In a period with stable restrictions, we estimated an increased B.1.1.7 transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%,60%]) relative to other lineages. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that 37% of B.1.1.7 cases were related to the initial introduction in November 2020. Continuous introductions contributed substantially to case numbers, highlighting the benefit of balanced travel restrictions and self-isolation procedures coupled with comprehensive surveillance efforts, to sustain epidemic control in the face of emerging variants.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher
477	10.1101/2021.07.26.453518	Airborne transmission, a term combining both large droplet and aerosol transmission, is thought to be the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher
478	10.1101/2021.02.06.21251159	As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

We develop the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detect an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage. In concert with other variants, like B.1.1.7, the rise of B.1.526 appears to have extended the duration of the second wave of COVID-19 cases in NYC in early 2021.

We conducted a single center prospective study between July and September 2021 at the drive-through testing center of the Toulouse University Hospital. We compared the NP VL of 3775 patients infected by the Delta (n = 3637) and Alpha (n = 138) variants, respectively. Patient’s symptoms and vaccination status (2619 unvaccinated, 636 one dose and 520 two doses) were recorded. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing and variant screening were assessed by using Thermo Fisher(®) TaqPath™ COVID-19 and ID solutions(®) ID™ SARS-CoV-2/VOC evolution Pentaplex assays. Delta SARS-CoV-2 infections were associated with higher VL than Alpha (coef = 0.68; p ≤ 0.01) independently of patient’s vaccination status, symptoms, age and sex. This difference was higher for patients diagnosed late after symptom onset (coef = 0.88; p = 0.01) than for those diagnosed early (coef = 0.43; p = 0.03). Infections in vaccinated patients were associated with lower VL (coef = −0.18; p ≤ 0.01) independently of virus variant, symptom, age and sex. Our results suggest that Delta infections could lead to higher VL and for a longer period compared to Alpha infections. By effectively reducing the NP VL, vaccination could allow for limiting viral spread, even with the Delta variant.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: viral_load | level: higher

484	10.1172/jci.insight.155483	Isolation guidelines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are largely derived from data collected prior to the emergence of the delta variant. We followed a cohort of ambulatory patients with postvaccination breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections with longitudinal collection of nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification, whole-genome sequencing, and viral culture. All delta variant infections in our cohort were symptomatic, compared with 64% of non-delta variant infections. Symptomatic delta variant breakthrough infections were characterized by higher initial viral load, longer duration of virologic shedding by PCR, greater likelihood of replication-competent virus at early stages of infection, and longer duration of culturable virus compared with non-delta variants. The duration of time since vaccination was also correlated with both duration of PCR positivity and duration of detection of replication-competent virus. Nonetheless, no individuals with symptomatic delta variant infections had replication-competent virus by day 10 after symptom onset or 24 hours after resolution of symptoms. These data support US CDC isolation guidelines as of November 2021, which recommend isolation for 10 days or until symptom resolution and reinforce the importance of prompt testing and isolation among symptomatic individuals with delta breakthrough infections. Additional data are needed to evaluate these relationships among asymptomatic and more severe delta variant breakthrough infections.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: viral_load | level: higher

499	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104936	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Reports of new variants that potentially increase virulence and viral transmission, as well as reduce the efficacy of available vaccines, have recently emerged. In this study, we computationally analyzed the N439K, S477 N, and T478K variants for their ability to bind Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used the protein-protein docking approach to explore whether the three variants displayed a higher binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor than the wild type. We found that these variants alter the hydrogen bonding network and the cluster of interactions. Additional salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and a high number of non-bonded contacts (i.e., non-bonded interactions between atoms in the same molecule and those in other molecules) were observed only in the mutant complexes, allowing efficient binding to the ACE2 receptor. Furthermore, we used a 2.0-μs all-atoms simulation approach to detect differences in the structural dynamic features of the resulting protein complexes. Our findings revealed that the mutant complexes possessed stable dynamics, consistent with the global trend of mutations yielding variants with improved stability and enhanced affinity. Binding energy calculations based on molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) further revealed that electrostatic interactions principally increased net binding energies. The stability and binding energies of N439K, S477 N, and T478K variants were enhanced compared to the wild-type-ACE2 complex. The net binding energy of the systems was −31.86 kcal/mol for the wild-type-ACE2 complex, −67.85 kcal/mol for N439K, −69.82 kcal/mol for S477 N, and −69.64 kcal/mol for T478K. The current study provides a basis for exploring the enhanced binding abilities and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 variants to design novel therapeutics against the virus.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N439K | effect: intermolecular_interactions | level: higher

We used the protein-protein docking approach to explore whether the three variants displayed a higher binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor than the wild type. We found that these variants alter the hydrogen bonding network and the cluster of interactions. Additional salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and a high number of non-bonded contacts (i.e., non-bonded interactions between atoms in the same molecule and those in other molecules) were observed only in the mutant complexes, allowing efficient binding to the ACE2 receptor. Furthermore, we used a 2.0-μs all-atoms simulation approach to detect differences in the structural dynamic features of the resulting protein complexes. Our findings revealed that the mutant complexes possessed stable dynamics, consistent with the global trend of mutations yielding variants with improved stability and enhanced affinity. Binding energy calculations based on molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) further revealed that electrostatic interactions principally increased net binding energies. The stability and binding energies of N439K, S477 N, and T478K variants were enhanced compared to the wild-type-ACE2 complex. The net binding energy of the systems was −31.86 kcal/mol for the wild-type-ACE2 complex, −67.85 kcal/mol for N439K, −69.82 kcal/mol for S477 N, and −69.64 kcal/mol for T478K. The current study provides a basis for exploring the enhanced binding abilities and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 variants to design novel therapeutics against the virus.	mutation_name: SPIKE_S477 N | effect: intermolecular_interactions | level: higher

505	10.22209/ic.v62s2a02	Variants of Concern of SARS-CoV-2 (VOCs), the new coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, have emerged in several countries. Mutations in the amino acid 484 of the Spike protein are particularly important and associated with some of these variants: E484K or E484Q. These mutations have been associated with evasion to neutralizing antibodies. Restriction enzyme analysis is proposed as a rapid method to detect these mutations. A search on GISAID was performed in April 2021 to detect the frequency of these two mutations in the sequence available and their association with other lineages. E484K, present in some VOCs, has emerged in several other lineages and is frequently found in recent viral isolates. A small amplicon from the Spike gene was digested with two enzymes: HpyAV, and MseI. The use of these two enzymes allows the detection of mutations at position 484, and to differentiate between these three conditions: non-mutated, and the presence of E484K or E484Q. A 100% correlation was observed with sequencing results. The proposed methodology, which allows for the screening of a great number of samples, will probably help to provide more information on the prevalence and epidemiology of these mutations worldwide, to select the candidates for whole-genome sequencing.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect: immune_escape | level: higher

506	10.1101/2020.03.27.012013	The effect of the rapid accumulation of non-synonymous mutations on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known. To predict the impact of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions identified in ORF3a on the formation of B-cell epitopes and their role in evading the immune response, nucleotide and protein sequences of 537 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions. Mutations were correlated with changes in epitope formation. A total of 19 different non-synonymous amino acids substitutions were detected in ORF3a among 537 SARS-CoV-2 strains. G251V was the most common and identified in 9.9% (n=53) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a B-cell like epitope in ORF3a. Polyproline regions were detected in two strains (EPI_ISL_410486, France and EPI_ISL_407079, Finland) and affected epitopes formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations and detected polyproline regions in ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 could be driving the evasion of the host immune response thus favoring viral spread. Rapid mutations accumulating in ORF3a should be closely monitored throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Importance At the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic and after three months of the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the disease-causing pathogen, nucleic acid changes due to host-pathogen interactions are insightful into the evolution of this virus. In this paper, we have identified a set of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a and predicted their impact on B-cell like epitope formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a could be driving protein changes that mediate immune evasion and favoring viral spread.	mutation_name: ORF3A_G251V | effect: protein_functioning | level: lower

510	10.3390/v13050883	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, as observed with the D614G spike protein mutant and, more recently, with B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) and B.1.1.28.1 (P.1) lineages, represent a continuous threat and might lead to strains of higher infectivity and/or virulence. We report on the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 haplotype with nine mutations including D614G/T307I double-mutation of the spike. This variant expanded and completely replaced previous lineages within a short period in the subantarctic Magallanes Region, southern Chile. The rapid lineage shift was accompanied by a significant increase of cases, resulting in one of the highest incidence rates worldwide. Comparative coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations indicated that T307I and D614G belong to a previously unrecognized dynamic domain, interfering with the mobility of the receptor binding domain of the spike. The T307I mutation showed a synergistic effect with the D614G. Continuous surveillance of new mutations and molecular analyses of such variations are important tools to understand the molecular mechanisms defining infectivity and virulence of current and future SARS-CoV-2 strains.	mutation_name: P.1 | effect: viral_virulence | level: higher
511	10.1016/j.meegid.2022.105279	As surges of the COVID-19 pandemic continue globally, including in Palestine, several new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been introduced. This expansion has impacted transmission, disease severity, virulence, diagnosis, therapy, and natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Here, 183 whole genome sequences (WGS) were analyzed, of which 129 were from Palestinian cases, 62 of which were collected in 11 Palestinian districts between October 2020 and April 2021and sequenced completely . A dramatic shift from the wild type to the Alpha variant (B 1.1.7) was observed within a short period of time. Cluster mapping revealed statistically significant clades in two main Palestinian cities, Al-Khalil (Monte Carlo hypothesis test-Poisson model, P = 0.00000000012) and Nablus (Monte Carlo hypothesis test-Poisson model, P = 0.014 and 0.015). The phylogenetic tree showed three main clusters of SARS-CoV-2 with high bootstrap values (>90). However, population genetics analysis showed a genetically homogenous population supported by low Wright's F-statistic values (Fst <0.25), high gene flow (Nm > 3), and statistically insignificant Tajima's D values (Tajima's test, neutrality model prediction, P = 0.02). The Alpha variant, rapidly replaced the wild type, causing a major surge that peaked in April 2021, with an increased COVID-19 mortality rate, especially, in the Al-Khalil and Nablus districts. The source of introduction remains uncertain, despite the minimal genetic variation. The study substantiates the use of WGS for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance as an early warning system to track down new variants requiring effective control.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: fatality_rate | level: higher
512	10.1016/j.isci.2021.103589	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha), a WHO variant of concern (VOC) first identified in the UK in late 2020, contains several mutations including P681H in the spike S1/S2 cleavage site, which is predicted to increase cleavage by furin, potentially impacting the viral cell entry. Here, we studied the role of the P681H mutation in B.1.1.7 cell entry. We performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.1.7 S1/S2 sequence and observed no significant difference in furin cleavage. Functional assays using pseudoparticles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spikes and cell-to-cell fusion assays demonstrated no differences between Wuhan-Hu-1, B.1.1.7 or a P681H point mutant. Likewise, we observed no differences in viral growth between USA-WA1/2020 and a B.1.1.7 isolate in cell culture. Our findings suggest that while the B.1.1.7 P681H mutation may slightly increase S1/S2 cleavage this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread.	mutation_name: SPIKE_P681H | effect: entry_efficiency | level: unaffected

515	10.1101/2021.01.18.426984	Recently, a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage called B.1.1.7 has emerged in the United Kingdom that was reported to spread more efficiently than other strains. This variant has an unusually large number of mutations with 10 amino acid changes in the spike protein, raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 16 participants in a previously reported trial with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had equivalent neutralizing titers to both variants. These data, together with the combined immunity involving humoral and cellular effectors induced by this vaccine, make it unlikely that the B.1.1.7 lineage will escape BNT162b2-mediated protection.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera | level: unaffected
516	10.1038/s41586-021-03412-7	SARS-CoV-2 transmission is uncontrolled in many parts of the world, compounded in some areas by higher transmission potential of the B1.1.7 variant1 now reported in 94 countries. It is unclear whether responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the prototypic strain will be impacted by mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralising antibody responses following first and second immunisations using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein. The vaccine sera exhibited a broad range of neutralising titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some convalescent patients. Decreased B.1.1.7 neutralisation was also observed with monoclonal antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10), the RBM (5 out of 31), but not in RBD neutralising mAbs binding outside the RBM. Introduction of the E484K mutation in a B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emergent Variant of Concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more substantial loss of neutralising activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and mAbs (19 out of 31) over that conferred by the B.1.1.7 mutations alone.

These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351. In contrast, sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals similarly bound the three spike proteins in a flow cytometry-based serological assay. Neutralizing antibodies were rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees. Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels.

Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels.

528	10.1038/s41591-021-01318-5	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, and have since spread to many countries. These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351.

529	10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.033	SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 2M deaths in little over a year. Vaccines are being deployed at scale, aiming to generate responses against the virus spike. The scale of the pandemic and error-prone virus replication is leading to the appearance of mutant viruses and potentially escape from antibody responses. Variant B.1.1.7, now dominant in the UK, with increased transmission, harbours 9 amino-acid changes in the spike, including N501Y in the ACE2 interacting-surface. We examine the ability of B.1.1.7 to evade antibody responses elicited by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We map the impact of N501Y by structure/function analysis of a large panel of well-characterised monoclonal antibodies. B.1.1.7 is harder to neutralize than parental virus, compromising neutralization by some members of a major class of public antibodies through light chain contacts with residue 501. However, widespread escape from monoclonal antibodies or antibody responses generated by natural infection or vaccination was not observed.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

Here, we compared B.1.617 variants for neutralization resistance by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 pseudoviruses showed a modest 1.5- to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 pseudoviruses, but 7- and 16-fold reductions for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, were seen for B.1.351 pseudoviruses.

In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 pseudoviruses, but 7- and 16-fold reductions for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, were seen for B.1.351 pseudoviruses. Among twenty-three therapeutic antibodies tested, four antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses and six antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 and AY.1 pseudoviruses. Our results indicate that the current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants. Finally, the P681R substitution confers efficient cleavage of B.1.617 variants’ spike proteins and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.	mutation_name: R.1 | effect: sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera | level: lower

Here, we use a live virus neutralization assay with sera from Pfizer- and Moderna-vaccinated individuals to examine neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 and observe a 3.9- and 2.7-fold reduction, respectively, in neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant compared with an early isolate bearing only a D614G substitution in its spike protein. We observe similar reduced sensitivity with sera from hamsters that were previously infected with an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Despite this reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant, hamsters previously infected (up to 15 months earlier) with an early isolate are protected from infection with the Delta variant, suggesting that the immune response to the first infection is sufficient to provide protection against subsequent infection with the Delta variant.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera | level: lower

Methods Through the prospective COVID Symptom Study, 109,626 UK school-aged children were proxy-reported between December 28, 2020 and July 8, 2021. We selected all symptomatic children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were proxy-reported at least weekly, within two timeframes: December 28, 2020 to May 6, 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) the main UK circulating variant); and May 26 to July 8, 2021 (Delta the main UK circulating variant). We assessed illness profiles (symptom prevalence, duration, and burden), hospital presentation, and presence of long (>28 day) illness; and calculated odds ratios for symptoms presenting within the first 28 days of illness. Findings 694 (276 younger [5 11 years], 418 older [12 17 years]) symptomatic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with Alpha infection and 706 (227 younger and 479 older) children with Delta infection. Median illness duration was short with either variant (overall cohort: 5 days (IQR 2 9.75) with Alpha, 5 days (IQR 2 9) with Delta). The seven most prevalent symptoms were common to both variants. Symptom burden over the first 28 days was slightly greater with Delta compared with Alpha infection (in younger children, 3 (IQR 2 5) with Alpha, 4 (IQR 2 7) with Delta; in older children 5 (IQR 3 8) with Alpha and 6 (IQR 3 9) with Delta infection in older children). The odds of several symptoms were higher with Delta than Alpha infection, including headache and fever. Few children presented to hospital, and long illness duration was uncommon, with either variant. Interpretation COVID-19 in UK school-aged children due to SARSCoV2 Delta strain B.1.617.2 resembles illness due to the Alpha variant B.1.1.7., with short duration and similar symptom burden.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: infection_duration | level: lower

552	10.1101/2022.02.14.480347	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant is replacing Delta, the most prevalent variant worldwide from the beginning of 2021 until early 2022. The Omicron variant is highly transmissible and responsible for a new worldwide COVID-19 wave. Herein, we calculated molecular dynamics simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (wild type, WT) and the Omicron variant of concern. Structural analyses reveal that the SpikeOmicron presents more conformational flexibility than SpikeWT, mainly in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such flexibility results in a broader spectrum of different conformations for SpikeOmicron, whereby the RBD can more easily visit an up-conformational state. We reported how the mutations in this variant may influence the intra- and inter-protomer contacts caused by conformational flexibility. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the differences in conformational flexibility between SpikeOmicron and SpikeWT may explain the observed gains in infectivity, immune system evasion and transmissibility in this novel variant.

557	10.1002/cbic.202100191	The evolution of new SARS‐CoV‐2 variants around the globe has made the COVID‐19 pandemic more worrisome, further pressuring the health care system and immunity. Novel variations that are unique to the receptor‐binding motif (RBM) of the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) spike glycoprotein, i. e. L452R‐E484Q, may play a different role in the B.1.617 (also known as G/452R.V3) variant's pathogenicity and better survival compared to the wild type. Therefore, a thorough analysis is needed to understand the impact of these mutations on binding with host receptor (RBD) and to guide new therapeutics development. In this study, we used structural and biomolecular simulation techniques to explore the impact of specific mutations (L452R‐E484Q) in the B.1.617 variant on the binding of RBD to the host receptor ACE2. Our analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic‐stability, residual flexibility and structural compactness. Moreover, the new variant had altered the bonding network and structural‐dynamics properties significantly. MM/GBSA technique was used, which further established the binding differences between the wild type and B.1.617 variant. In conclusion, this study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the new SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.	mutation_name: B.1.617 | effect: viral_fitness | level: higher

The N501Y mutation within the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of these SARS‐CoV‐2 variants may enhance binding to the human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). However, no molecular explanation for such an enhanced affinity has so far been provided. Here, using all‐atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show that Y501 in the mutated RBD can be well‐coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, which may increase the overall binding affinity of the RBD for hACE2 by approximately 0.81 kcal·mol(−1). The binding dynamics revealed in our study may provide a working model to facilitate the design of more effective antibodies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: infectivity | level: higher

570	10.3390/ijms22115464	The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Currently, most of the research efforts towards the development of vaccines and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were mainly focused on the spike (S) protein, which mediates virus entry into the host cell by binding to ACE2. As the virus SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, variants have emerged, characterized by multiple mutations of the S glycoprotein. Herein, we employed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of the mutations of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 (B.1.1.7), termed the “UK variant”, in comparison with the wild type, with the aim to decipher the structural basis of the reported increased infectivity and virulence. The simulations provided insights on the different dynamics of UK and wild-type S glycoprotein, regarding in particular the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). In addition, we investigated the role of glycans in modulating the conformational transitions of the RBD. The overall results showed that the UK mutant experiences higher flexibility in the RBD with respect to wild type; this behavior might be correlated with the increased transmission reported for this variant. Our work also adds useful structural information on antigenic “hotspots” and epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: infectivity | level: higher

574	10.33696/immunology.3.085	New globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains are causing concern about evolution of virus transmissibility, fitness and immune evasion mechanisms. A variant emerging from the United Kingdom called SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, or B.1.1.7, is thought to exhibit increased transmissibility that results from replication 4–10 times faster than the original Wuhan virus (Wuhan-Hu-1). Although this property is suspected to result from a specific mutation in the spike glycoprotein, D614G, there are 9 mutations that distinguish the UK variant B.1.1.7 from Wuhan-Hu-1 yet to be evaluated for functional effects. We asked if mutated positions fixed in UK variant B.1.1.7 may be involved in the virus life cycle, or evasion of the immune response, by modeling the UK variant spike protein and conducting structural analysis of mutations on the spike glycoprotein trimer (protomer) complexed to ACE2. Importantly, 4 out of 9 differences between the UK variant B.1.1.7 and Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein alter direct intermolecular interactions. N501Y increased affinity between the spike protein and ACE2. The mutations at A570D, D614G and S982A reduced contact between individual chains of the trimeric spike protomer, potentially enhancing cleavage into S1 and S2 subunits, dynamic structural rearrangement and host cell fusion mechanisms.

579	10.33696/immunology.3.085	New globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains are causing concern about evolution of virus transmissibility, fitness and immune evasion mechanisms. A variant emerging from the United Kingdom called SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, or B.1.1.7, is thought to exhibit increased transmissibility that results from replication 4–10 times faster than the original Wuhan virus (Wuhan-Hu-1). Although this property is suspected to result from a specific mutation in the spike glycoprotein, D614G, there are 9 mutations that distinguish the UK variant B.1.1.7 from Wuhan-Hu-1 yet to be evaluated for functional effects. We asked if mutated positions fixed in UK variant B.1.1.7 may be involved in the virus life cycle, or evasion of the immune response, by modeling the UK variant spike protein and conducting structural analysis of mutations on the spike glycoprotein trimer (protomer) complexed to ACE2. Importantly, 4 out of 9 differences between the UK variant B.1.1.7 and Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein alter direct intermolecular interactions. N501Y increased affinity between the spike protein and ACE2. The mutations at A570D, D614G and S982A reduced contact between individual chains of the trimeric spike protomer, potentially enhancing cleavage into S1 and S2 subunits, dynamic structural rearrangement and host cell fusion mechanisms.

We have examined the structure and receptor binding properties of spike proteins from the B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (SA) variants to better understand the evolution of the virus in humans. Both variants’ spikes have the same mutation, N501Y, in their receptor-binding domains that confers tighter ACE2 binding and this substitution relies on a common earlier substitution (D614G) to achieve the tighter binding. Each variant spike has also acquired a key change in structure that impacts virus pathogenesis. Unlike other SARS-CoV-2 spikes, the spike from the UK variant is stable against detrimerisation on binding ACE2. This feature primarily arises from the acquisition of a substitution at the S1-S2 furin site that allows for near-complete cleavage. In the SA variant spike, the presence of a new substitution, K417N, again on the background of the D614G substitution, enables the spike trimer to adopt fully open conformations that are required for receptor binding.

However, the molecular consequences of mutations within B.1.1.7 on spike protein dynamics and stability or ACE2 binding are largely unknown. Here, molecular dynamics simulations comparing SARS-CoV-2 wild type with the B.1.1.7 variant revealed inter-trimeric contact rearrangements, altering the structural flexibility within the spike protein trimer. Furthermore, we found increased flexibility in direct spatial proximity of the fusion peptide due to salt bridge rearrangements induced by the D614G mutation in B.1.1.7. This study also implies a reduced binding affinity for B.1.1.7 with ACE2, as the N501Y mutation restructures the RBD–ACE2 interface, significantly decreasing the linear interaction energy between the RBD and ACE2.

Here we report cryo-EM structures of the spike protein of B.1.1.7 in the apo and ACE2-bound forms. The apo form showed one or two receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in the open conformation, without populating the fully closed state. All three RBDs were engaged in ACE2 binding.

597	10.3390/v14030545	Omicron is the most mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant—a factor that can affect transmissibility, disease severity, and immune evasiveness. Its genomic surveillance is important in cities with millions of inhabitants and an economic center, such as Mexico City. Results. From 16 November to 31 December 2021, we observed an increase of 88% in Omicron prevalence in Mexico City. We explored the R346K substitution, prevalent in 42% of Omicron variants, known to be associated with immune escape by monoclonal antibodies. In a phylogenetic analysis, we found several independent exchanges between Mexico and the world, and there was an event followed by local transmission that gave rise to most of the Omicron diversity in Mexico City. A haplotype analysis revealed that there was no association between haplotype and vaccination status. Among the 66% of patients who have been vaccinated, no reported comorbidities were associated with Omicron; the presence of odynophagia and the absence of dysgeusia were significant predictor symptoms for Omicron, and the RT-qPCR Ct values were lower for Omicron. Conclusions. Genomic surveillance is key to detecting the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a timely manner, even weeks before the onset of an infection wave, and can inform public health decisions and detect the spread of any mutation that may affect therapeutic efficacy.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect: viral_transmission | level: undefined

606	10.3390/v14030650	There is a growing interest in using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the early stages of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to prevent disease progression. Little is known about the efficacy of mAbs against the delta variant of concern and its clinical presentations. We evaluated the effect of casirivimab/imdevimab treatment among five delta vaccine breakthrough patients. Symptomatic non-hospitalized vaccinated patients were submitted to nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Blood analysis and chest Computed Tomography were also performed. A cocktail of casirivimab/imdevimab was administrated, and patients were monitored weekly. Clinical evolution was evaluated by the regression of the symptoms, negative results by real-time RT-PCR, and by the need of hospitalization: these aspects were considered as significant outcomes. In four cases, symptom reversion and viral load reduction were observed within 2 days and 7 days after mAbs treatment, respectively. Only one case, suffering from thymoma, was hospitalized 2 days later because of respiratory failure, which reverted within 18 days. mAbs treatment seems to be safe and effective against the delta variant and its clinical manifestations.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: unaffected

We aimed to investigate the impact of infection on clinical severity of illness, including the need for oxygen or ventilation in a national cohort study. Methods In this prospective clinical cohort study, 1475 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from patients infected in Scotland, UK between the 1st November 2020 and 30th January 2021 and matched to clinical outcomes as the lineage became dominant in Scotland. We modelled the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease using a cumulative generalised linear mixed model employing a 4-point scale of maximum severity based on requirement of respiratory support at 28 days. We also estimated the growth rate of B.1.1.7-associated infections as it emerged in Scotland using a phylogenetic exponential growth rate population model. Results The B.1.1.7 lineage was responsible for a third wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Scotland in association with a transmission rate 5-fold higher than the preceding second wave B.1.177 lineage. Of 1475 patients, 364 were infected with B.1.1.7, 1030 with B.1.177 and 81 with other lineages. Our analysis found a positive association between increased clinical severity and lineage (B.1.1.7 versus non-B.1.1.7; cumulative odds ratio: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.93). Viral load was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) value (mean Ct change: -2.46, 95% CI: -4.22, -0.70).

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the analytical performance of the Allplex™SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay for the additional presumptive identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a real-life setting. RESULTS: We observed gene-specific changes in the cycle threshold (Ct) of the N and RdRp genes compared with the Ct yielded for the S gene when the SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed Allplex™SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay. Seventeen samples showed Ct variations in the N and/or RdRp. In 10 cases, the N gene was affected, delayed or negative and in 14 cases, the RdRp gene showed a delay or negative concerning the S gene. A delay in the Ct of both genes (RdRp and N) was observed in six cases. Sequencing determined that all samples identified as B.1.1.7 showed changes in the PCR curves of the N and RdRp. However, samples identified as B.1.177 only showed variations for the RdRp gene.

Our high-volume laboratory introduced a PCR variant assay (Variant PCR) in January 2021 based on the protocol by Vogels et al. STUDY DESIGN: : To assess whether Variant PCR could be used for rapid B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 screening, all positive SARS-CoV-2 airway samples were prospectively tested in parallel using both the Variant PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: : In total 1,642 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from individual patients were tested within a time span of 4 weeks. For all samples with valid results from both Variant PCR and WGS, no VoC was missed by Variant PCR (totalling 399 VoC detected). Conversely, all of the samples identified as “other lineages” (i.e., “non-VoC lineages”) by the Variant PCR, were confirmed by WGS. CONCLUSIONS: : The Variant PCR based on the protocol by Vogels et al., is an effective method for rapid screening for VoC, applicable for most diagnostic laboratories within a pandemic setting. WGS is still required to confirm the identity of certain variants and for continuous surveillance of emerging VoC.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

Conversely, all of the samples identified as “other lineages” (i.e., “non-VoC lineages”) by the Variant PCR, were confirmed by WGS. CONCLUSIONS: : The Variant PCR based on the protocol by Vogels et al., is an effective method for rapid screening for VoC, applicable for most diagnostic laboratories within a pandemic setting. WGS is still required to confirm the identity of certain variants and for continuous surveillance of emerging VoC.	mutation_name: B.1.351 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

METHODS: : Suspected and non-suspected cases of VOC B.1.1.7 were defined according to the VirSNiP assay, which detects N501Y and deletion H69-V70. For pre-screening, the Allplex™ and TaqPath assays were used. RESULTS: : One hundred and sixteen suspected and 113 non-suspected cases were included. In the suspected cases, the Allplex assay showed N-gene dropout, or delayed Ct values of 6.27±1.21 and 6.66±1.41 compared with those of the RdRP and S-gene target, respectively. Agreement between the Allplex and TaqPath assays was 100% when the RdRP and S-gene targets had Ct values <35. Agreement between the Allplex and VirSNiP assays was 100% with Ct value <30. CONCLUSIONS: : The Allplex assay showed excellent agreement with the current pre-screening method for VOC B.1.1.7. In addition, its automated processing enhances the feasibility of widespread use in laboratories.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics | level: unaffected
618	10.1080/07391102.2021.1982775	Spike (S) protein has been recognized as a promising molecular target for diagnostic, vaccines and antiviral drugs development for COVID-19. In this study, we analyzed the most predominant mutations in the S protein of Brazilian isolates and predicted the effect of these amino acid alterations to protein conformation. A total of 25,924 sequences were obtained from GISAID for five regions of Brazilian territory (Midwest, North, Northeast, South, and Southeast), according to exclusion criteria. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates belongs to the G clade and showed a large occurrence of D614G, N501Y and L18F substitutions. Prediction effects of these amino acid substitutions on the structure dynamics of the spike protein indicated a positive ΔΔG values and negative ΔΔSVib in most cases which is associated to structural stabilization and flexibility reduction of the S protein. Mutations E484K, N501Y and K417N belong to several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, and showed high incidence among Brazilian isolates. These mutations have been described to increase RBD affinity to ACE-2 host and abolishment of RBD affinity to potent neutralizing ant-RBD. The increase in rates of infection and reinfection requires continuous genomic surveillance studies in order to characterize emerging mutations and monitor vaccine efficacy, and thus consideration structural data and dynamics in the observed phenotypes.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

620	10.1016/j.immuni.2021.03.023	Interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the receptor ACE2 on host cells is essential for viral entry. RBD is the dominant target for neutralizing antibodies, and several neutralizing epitopes on RBD have been molecularly characterized. Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD, N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 subunits of Spike. To understand how these mutations affect Spike antigenicity, we isolated and characterized >100 monoclonal antibodies targeting epitopes on RBD, NTD, and S2 from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Approximately 45% showed neutralizing activity, of which ∼20% were NTD specific. NTD-specific antibodies formed two distinct groups: the first was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred neutralization resistance to NTD-specific antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes should be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: sensitivity_to_antibodies | level: lower

Here, we exploit the advances of protein structure fingerprint technology to study the folding conformational changes induced by mutations. With integration of both protein sequences and folding conformations, the structures are aligned for SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, including Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) and Delta variant (lineage B.1.617.2). The results showed that the virus evolution with change in mutational positions and physicochemical properties increased the affinity between spike protein and ACE2, which plays a critical role in coronavirus entry into human cells.

The analysis of structural variations revealed how the coronavirus has gradually evolved in both structure and function and how the SARS-CoV-2 variants have contributed to more severe acute disease worldwide.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines | level: no evidence

Although the sensitivity of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has been investigated, sensitivity to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cellular immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that two recently emerging mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429 and B.1.617) and Y453F (in B.1.1.298), confer escape from HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce affinity toward the host entry receptor ACE2. Notably, the L452R mutation increases spike stability, viral infectivity, viral fusogenicity, and thereby promotes viral replication. These data suggest that HLA-restricted cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes and that a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is escape from cellular immunity.	mutation_name: SPIKE_L452R | effect: immune_escape | level: higher

SARS-CoV-2 cell infection is initiated by a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein, a fusion protein, binding human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), that acts as the functional receptor through the receptor binding domain (RBD). In this article, the interaction of hACE2 with the RBD and how fusion is initiated after recognition are explored, as well as how mutations influence infectivity and immune response. Thus, we focused on all structures available in the Protein Data Bank for the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and hACE2. Specifically, the Delta variant carries particular mutations associated with increased viral fitness through decreased antibody binding, increased RBD affinity and altered protein dynamics. Combining both existing mutations and mutagenesis studies, new potential SARS-CoV-2 variants, harboring advantageous S protein mutations, may be predicted.

636	10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104815	The D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein emerged in early 2020 and quickly became the dominant circulating strain in Europe and its environs. The variant was characterized by the higher viral load, which is not associated with disease severity, higher incorporation into the virion, and high cell entry via ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. Previous strains of the coronavirus and the current SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated the selection of mutations as a mechanism of escaping immune responses. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding energy analysis to provide insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and describe the neutralization mechanism of this variant. Our results show that the D614G S-protein adopts distinct conformational dynamics which is skewed towards the open-state conformation more than the closed-state conformation of the wild-type S-protein. Residue-specific variation of amino acid flexibility and domain-specific RMSD suggest that the mutation causes an allosteric conformational change in the RBD. Evaluation of the interaction energies between the S-protein and neutralizing antibodies show that the mutation may enhance, reduce or not affect the neutralizing interactions depending on the neutralizing antibody, especially if it targets the RBD.

Additionally, the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore, we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail. We suggest that future efforts should diversify the epitopes targeted by antibodies and antibody cocktails to make them more resilient to antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: lower

COVID-19 patients infected with the Delta variant have a higher risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. The Delta variant is becoming the dominant strain in many countries around the world. This review summarizes and analyses the biological characteristics of key amino acid mutations, the epidemic characteristics, and the immune escape of the Delta variant.

650	10.1503/cmaj.211248	BACKGROUND: Between February and June 2021, the initial wild-type strains of SARS-CoV-2 were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, by new variants of concern (VOCs), first those with the N501Y mutation (i.e., Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants) and then the Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. METHODS: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables. We adjusted models for age, sex, time, vaccination status, comorbidities and pregnancy status. We included health units as random intercepts. RESULTS: Our cohort included 212 326 people. Compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42%–63%) for hospitalization, 89% (95% CI 67%–117%) for ICU admission and 51% (95% CI 30%–78%) for death. Increased risk with the Delta variant was more pronounced at 108% (95% CI 78%–140%) for hospitalization, 235% (95% CI 160%–331%) for ICU admission and 133% (95% CI 54%–231%) for death. INTERPRETATION: The increasing virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will lead to a considerably larger, and more deadly, pandemic than would have occurred in the absence of the emergence of VOCs.	mutation_name: ALPHA | effect: viral_virulence | level: higher

651	10.1503/cmaj.211248	BACKGROUND: Between February and June 2021, the initial wild-type strains of SARS-CoV-2 were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, by new variants of concern (VOCs), first those with the N501Y mutation (i.e., Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants) and then the Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. METHODS: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables. We adjusted models for age, sex, time, vaccination status, comorbidities and pregnancy status. We included health units as random intercepts. RESULTS: Our cohort included 212 326 people. Compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42%–63%) for hospitalization, 89% (95% CI 67%–117%) for ICU admission and 51% (95% CI 30%–78%) for death.

In the present in-silico study, 15,928 sequences of Orf3a reported worldwide were compared to identify variations in this protein. Our analysis revealed the occurrence of mutations at 173 residues of Orf3a protein. Subsequently, protein modelling was performed that revealed twelve mutations which can considerably affect the stability of Orf3a. Among the 12 mutations, three mutations (Y160H, D210Y and S171L) also lead to alterations in secondary structure and protein disorder parameters of the Orf3a protein. Further, we used predictive tools to identify five promising epitopes of B-cells, which resides in the mutated regions of Orf3a.

6	10.1101/2020.08.07.242263	Understanding the mutational and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for treating COVID-19 and the development of a vaccine. Here, we analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations. Our study provides theoretical support for vaccine development and the optimization of treatment for COVID-19. We call researchers to submit raw sequence data to public databases.	mutation_name: ORF3A_T164I | effect: viral_fitness | level: higher

8	10.1101/2020.08.07.242263	Understanding the mutational and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for treating COVID-19 and the development of a vaccine. Here, we analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations. Our study provides theoretical support for vaccine development and the optimization of treatment for COVID-19. We call researchers to submit raw sequence data to public databases.	mutation_name: ORF1A_Q6383H | effect: viral_fitness | level: higher
9	10.1371/journal.pone.0238665	This study aims to highlight SARS-COV-2 mutations which are associated with increased or decreased viral virulence. We utilize genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries’ regional information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.	mutation_name: ORF3A_Q57H | effect: protein_conformational_optimization | level: no evidence

13	10.1002/jmv.26417	Pandemic COVID‐19 outbreak has been caused due to SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogen, resulting millions of infection and death worldwide, USA being on top at the present moment. The long, complex orf1ab polyproteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 play an important role in viral RNA synthesis. To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134 complete protein sequences of orf1ab polyprotein from NCBI Virus database from affected patients across various states of USA from December 2019 to 25(th) April 2020. Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega followed by statistical significance was calculated. Four significant mutations T265I (nsp 2), P4715L (nsp 12) and P5828L and Y5865C (both at nsp 13) were identified in important non‐structural proteins, which function either as replicase or helicase. A comparative analysis shows 265T→I, 5828P→L and 5865Y→C are unique to USA and not reported from Europe or Asia; while one, 4715P→L is predominant in both Europe and USA. Mutational changes in amino acids are predicted to alter structure and function of corresponding proteins, thereby it is imperative to consider the mutational spectra while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral orf1ab.

21	10.21203/rs.3.rs-877078/v1	Background: SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta coronavirus family responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic. The infection first emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide. The ongoing outbreak has posed an urgent worldwide health threat due to the rapid transmittable potential and high mortality rate. Due to the critical role of none structural protein − 12 (NSP-12) in COVID-19. This study tries to investigate the link between genotype-phenotype NSP-12 variation and the prevalence of this disease. Methods We analyzed approximately 2 million Nsp12 of SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence from January 2020 until June 2021. Python programming language was utilized to preprocess and apply inclusion criteria on FASTA files to prepare a list of suitable samples for clustering samples. NSP-12 regions were aligned to the reference sequence to compare and identify mutation patterns, categorized based on frequency and continent. Results The rate of ‌NSP-12 mutation in divided geographical areas was different. Based on continental studies, the P227L and G671S mutations have multiplied over time and in European and Asian societies in recent months. According to biochemical studies, the occurrence of G671S mutation increases the stability of the protein. Conclusion We concluded that NSP-12 P227L and G671S mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are increased in recent months. Further studies will be required to investigate whether these mutations impact the severity of the disease.	mutation_name: NSP12_G671S | effect: disease_severity | level: undefined

24	10.1038/s41467-022-29104-y	SARS-CoV-2 remdesivir resistance mutations have been generated in vitro but have not been reported in patients receiving treatment with the antiviral agent. We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with acquired B-cell deficiency who developed an indolent, protracted course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient virologic response, but her course was complicated by recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding. Whole genome sequencing identified a mutation, E802D, in the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which was not present in pre-treatment specimens. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation conferred a ~6-fold increase in remdesivir IC(50) but resulted in a fitness cost in the absence of remdesivir. Sustained clinical and virologic response was achieved after treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab. Although the fitness cost observed in vitro may limit the risk posed by E802D, this case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.	mutation_name: NSP12_E802D | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: lower

While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether many of these changes impact adaptation, replication, or transmission of the virus. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, virus stocks, and passaging experiments, together with kinetic virus replication data from nonhuman Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells. Overall, our study uncovers sequence features in SARS-CoV-2 variants that determine cell-specific replication and highlights the need to monitor SARS-CoV-2 stocks carefully when phenotyping newly emerging variants or potential variants of concern.	mutation_name: NSP2_T85I | effect: viral_replication | level: lower

Notably, naturally occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells. Overall, our study uncovers sequence features in SARS-CoV-2 variants that determine cell-specific replication and highlights the need to monitor SARS-CoV-2 stocks carefully when phenotyping newly emerging variants or potential variants of concern.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect: viral_replication | level: higher

Out of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 namely, spike, envelope, nucleocapsid and membrane, envelope protein governs the virus pathogenicity and induction of acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. These effects are facilitated by the viroporin (ion-channel) like activities of the envelope protein. Our current work reports metagenomic analysis of envelope protein at the amino acid sequence level through mining all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID and coronapp servers. We found majority of mutations in envelope protein were localized at or near PDZ binding motif. Our analysis also demonstrates that the acquired mutations might have important implications on its structure and ion-channel activity. A statistical correlation between specific mutations (e.g. F4F, R69I, P71L, L73F) with patient mortalities were also observed, based on the patient data available for 18,691 SARS-CoV-2-genomes in the GISAID database till 30 April 2021. Albeit, whether these mutations exist as the cause or the effect of co-infections and/or co-morbid disorders within COVID-19 patients is still unclear. Moreover, most of the current vaccine and therapeutic interventions are revolving around spike protein. However, emphasizing on envelope protein's (1) conserved epitopes, (2) pathogenicity attenuating mutations, and (3) mutations present in the deceased patients, as reported in our present study, new directions to the ongoing efforts of therapeutic developments against COVID-19 can be achieved by targeting envelope viroporin.	mutation_name: E_F4F | effect: fatality_rate | level: no evidence

34	10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104900	More than one year into a global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now defined by a variety of rapidly evolving variant lineages. Several FDA authorized molecular diagnostic tests have been impacted by viral variation, while no reports of viral variation affecting antigen test performance have occurred to date. While determining the analytical sensitivity of the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2), we uncovered a high viral load specimen that repeatedly tested negative by this antigen test. Whole genome sequencing of the specimen uncovered two mutations, T205I and D399N, present in the nucleocapsid protein of the isolate. All six SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens available in our laboratory with a D399N nucleocapsid mutation and C(T) < 31 were not detected by the Sofia 2 but detected by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, while clinical specimens with the T205I mutation were detected by both assays. Testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid with these variants demonstrated an approximate 1000-fold loss in sensitivity for the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test associated with the D399N mutation, while the BinaxNOW and Quidel Quickvue SARS Antigen tests were unaffected by the mutation. The D399N nucleocapsid mutation has been relatively uncommon to date, appearing in only 0.02% of genomes worldwide at time of writing. Our results demonstrate how routine pathogen genomics can be integrated into the clinical microbiology laboratory to investigate diagnostic edge cases, as well as the importance of profiling antigenic diversity outside of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.	mutation_name: N_D399N | effect: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics | level: lower

36	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.11.006	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic. Additionally, several SARS-CoV-2 variants have continuously challenged diagnostic testing due to viral diversity in spike and nucleocapsid (N) protein mutations. SARS-CoV-2-variant proliferation potentially affects N protein-targeted rapid antigen testing. We performed rapid antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests simultaneously in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To determine the N protein variations, direct whole-genome sequencing was performed, and the viral assemblies were uploaded to GISAID. We compared their genomes with those of global virus strains from GISAID. These isolates belonged to the B.1.1.7 variant, exhibiting several amino acid substitutions, including D3L, R203K, G204R, and S235F N protein mutations. We also identified the T135I mutation in one variant case in which rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests were discordantly negative and positive, respectively. Our findings suggest that the variants undetected by the PanbioTM COVID-19 rapid antigen test may be due to N-protein T135I mutations, posing a potential diagnostic risk to commercially available antigen tests. Hence, we recommend concomitant paired rapid antigen tests and molecular diagnostic methods to detect SARS-CoV-2. False-negative results could be rapidly corrected using confirmatory RT-PCR results to prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks.	mutation_name: N_T135I | effect: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics | level: lower
37	10.1016/j.genrep.2020.100997	The ongoing mutations in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the major impediment for prevention and control of the COVID-19 disease. Presently we focused on evolution of the envelope (E) protein, one of the most enigmatic and less studied protein among the four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) associated with multitude of immunopathological functions of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed 81,818 high quality E protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 globally available in the GISAID database as of 20 August 2020. Compared to Wuhan reference strain, our mutational analysis explored only 1.2 % (982/81818) mutant strains undergoing a total of 115 unique amino acid (aa) substitutions in the E protein, highlighting the fact that most (98.8 %) of the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 strains are highly conserved. Moreover, we found 58.77 % (134 of 228) nucleotides (nt) positions of SARS-CoV-2 E gene encountering a total of 176 unique nt-level mutations globally, which may affect the efficacy of real time RT-PCR-based molecular detection of COVID-19. Importantly, higher aa variations observed in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the E protein, particularly at Ser(55)-Phe(56), Arg(69) and the C-terminal end (DLLV: 72–75) may alter the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Envelope protein to tight junction-associated PALS1 and thus could play a key role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Furthermore, this study revealed the V25A mutation in the transmembrane domain which is a key factor for the homopentameric conformation of E protein. Our analysis also observed a triple cysteine motif harboring mutation (L39M, A41S, A41V, C43F, C43R, C43S, C44Y, N45R) which may hinder the binding of E protein with spike glycoprotein. These results therefore suggest the continuous monitoring of the structural proteins including the envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 since the number of genome sequences from across the world are continuously increasing.	mutation_name: E_V25A | effect: protein_conformational_optimization | level: no evidence
38	10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac049	Worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts track emerging mutations in its spike protein, as well as characteristic mutations in other viral proteins. Besides their epidemiological importance, the observed SARS-CoV-2 sequences present an ensemble of viable protein variants, and thereby a source of information on viral protein structure and function. Charting the mutational landscape of the nucleocapsid (N) protein that facilitates viral assembly, we observe variability exceeding that of the spike protein, with more than 86% of residues that can be substituted, on average by three to four different amino acids. However, mutations exhibit an uneven distribution that tracks known structural features but also reveals highly protected stretches of unknown function. One of these conserved regions is in the central disordered linker proximal to the N-G215C mutation that has become dominant in the Delta variant, outcompeting G215 variants without further spike or N-protein substitutions. Structural models suggest that the G215C mutation stabilizes conserved transient helices in the disordered linker serving as protein-protein interaction interfaces. Comparing Delta variant N-protein to its ancestral version in biophysical experiments, we find a significantly more compact and less disordered structure. N-G215C exhibits substantially stronger self-association, shifting the unliganded protein from a dimeric to a tetrameric oligomeric state, which leads to enhanced coassembly with nucleic acids. This suggests that the sequence variability of N-protein is mirrored by high plasticity of N-protein biophysical properties, which we hypothesize can be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to achieve greater efficiency of viral assembly, and thereby enhanced infectivity.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: protein_conformational_optimization | level: higher

The aim of the present study was to monitor the changes in genetic diversity and track non-synonymous substitutions (dN) that could be implicated in the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 and its spread in different regions between December 2019 and November 2020. We analyzed 2213 complete genomes from six geographical regions worldwide, which were downloaded from GenBank and GISAID databases. Although SARS-CoV-2 presented low genetic diversity, there has been an increase over time, with the presence of several hotspot mutations throughout its genome. We identified seven frequent mutations that resulted in dN substitutions. Two of them, C14408T>P323L and A23403G>D614G, located in the nsp12 and Spike protein, respectively, emerged early in the pandemic and showed a considerable increase in frequency over time. Two other mutations, A1163T>I120F in nsp2 and G22992A>S477N in the Spike protein, emerged recently and have spread in Oceania and Europe. There were associations of P323L, D614G, R203K and G204R substitutions with disease severity.

47	10.21203/rs.3.rs-51012/v1	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), originally emerged from Wuhan, has caused an unprecedented worldwide pandemic in the first half of 2020. Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 on March 10 th , 2020 in Turkey, more than 150,000 people in the country have been infected with this virus. In this study, a total of 80 genomic virulent strains from Turkey which were uploaded in NCBI and GISAID database were analyzed with other genomic sequences from different countries with the aim to characterize notable genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 and to identify some novel mutations. Consistent with other studies, the combination of variants at positions C3037T, C14408T and A23403G were most common mutations (73%), that exist together in isolates from Turkey. Our secondary structure prediction analysis also highlighted 11 unique non-substitutional mutations from viral SARS-COV-2 isolates of Turkey in different regions such as in spike (S) protein and non-structural proteins (Nsp2, Nsp3, NSP4, and NSP12/RdRP). Of these 11 mutations, nine of them have been found to be involved in structural alterations at different sites. 3/9 mutants (A771V, T1238I and G1251V) cause alteration in structure of S protein, while the rest of them induces structural changes in Nsp2 (A206T, R207C, T265I), Nsp3 (A1824V), Nsp4 (M2796I) and NSP12 (A4489V).

48	10.21203/rs.3.rs-51012/v1	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), originally emerged from Wuhan, has caused an unprecedented worldwide pandemic in the first half of 2020. Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 on March 10 th , 2020 in Turkey, more than 150,000 people in the country have been infected with this virus. In this study, a total of 80 genomic virulent strains from Turkey which were uploaded in NCBI and GISAID database were analyzed with other genomic sequences from different countries with the aim to characterize notable genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 and to identify some novel mutations. Consistent with other studies, the combination of variants at positions C3037T, C14408T and A23403G were most common mutations (73%), that exist together in isolates from Turkey. Our secondary structure prediction analysis also highlighted 11 unique non-substitutional mutations from viral SARS-COV-2 isolates of Turkey in different regions such as in spike (S) protein and non-structural proteins (Nsp2, Nsp3, NSP4, and NSP12/RdRP). Of these 11 mutations, nine of them have been found to be involved in structural alterations at different sites. 3/9 mutants (A771V, T1238I and G1251V) cause alteration in structure of S protein, while the rest of them induces structural changes in Nsp2 (A206T, R207C, T265I), Nsp3 (A1824V), Nsp4 (M2796I) and NSP12 (A4489V).

Differences in gene sequences may lead to changes in protein structure and traits, which would have a great impact on the epidemiological characteristics. In this study, we selected the key mutations of SARS-CoV-2, including D614G and A222V of S protein and Q57H of ORF3a protein, to conduct molecular dynamics simulation and analysis on the structures of the mutant proteins. The results suggested that D614G improved the stability of S protein, while A222V enhanced the ability of protein to react with the outside environment. Q57H enhanced the structural flexibility of ORF3a protein. Our findings could complete the mechanistic link between genotype--phenotype--epidemiological characteristics in the study of SARS-CoV-2. We also found no significant changes in the antigenicity of S protein, ORF3a protein and their mutants, which provides reference for vaccine development and application.	mutation_name: ORF3A_Q57H | effect: protein_flexibility | level: higher

In this study, we analyzed 129 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV-2 viruses of a Canadian population during early phase of the pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three major paths of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into Canada. Twenty-one substitutions that have frequencies greater than 3% of viral population were identified. Analysis of these substitutions indicated that P1427I (ORF1b), Y1464C (ORF1b), and Q57H (ORF3a) might affect functions of the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins. Additionally, we found the evidence of positive selection on the ORF3a and codon 614 of Spike protein, suggesting the viral components responsible for host entry and activation of inflammation response were targeted by host immune responses. The study showed genomic variation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a Canadian population. These information may help develop preventive strategies and be used for further study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and therapeutics development.	mutation_name: ORF3A_Q57H | effect: protein_functioning | level: no evidence

62	10.3390/v14020172	The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten healthcare systems worldwide due to the limited access to vaccines, suboptimal treatment options, and the continuous emergence of new and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Reverse-genetics studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes, green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated substitutions F480L and V570L—and naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and N491S, all in nsp12—did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient non-infectious subgenomic replicon system. The developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse-genetics systems, including recombinants to modify infectious viruses and non-infectious subgenomic replicons with autonomous genomic RNA replication, will permit high-throughput cell culture studies—providing fundamental understanding of basic biology of this coronavirus. We have proven the utility of the systems in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19. Our system provides a platform to effectively test the antiviral activity of drugs and the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.	mutation_name: NSP12_F480L | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: unaffected

We have proven the utility of the systems in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19. Our system provides a platform to effectively test the antiviral activity of drugs and the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.	mutation_name: NSP12_N491S | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: unaffected
67	10.1101/2021.08.05.455082	Newly evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants are driving ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 around the world. Efforts to determine why these viral variants have improved fitness are limited to mutations in the viral spike (S) protein and viral entry steps using non-SARS-CoV-2 viral particles engineered to display S. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and rapid dissection of multiple steps in the viral life cycle. Identification of an RNA packaging sequence was critical for engineered transcripts to assemble together with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) into non-replicative SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) that deliver these transcripts to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells. Using SC2-VLPs, we tested the effect of 30 individual mutations within the S and N proteins on particle assembly and entry. While S mutations unexpectedly did not affect these steps, SC2-VLPs bearing any one of four N mutations found universally in more-transmissible viral variants (P199L, S202R, R203M and R203K) showed increased particle production and up to 10-fold more reporter transcript expression in receiver cells. Our study provides a platform for rapid testing of viral variants outside a biosafety level 3 setting and identifies viral N mutations and viral particle assembly as mechanisms to explain the increased spread of current viral variants, including Delta (N:R203M).

Therefore, it becomes imperative to study and understand the effect of mutations on viral evolution, fitness and pathogenesis. In this regard, we performed a time-series analysis on 59541 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from around the world. These 59541 genomes were grouped according to the months (January 2020-March 2021) based on the collection date. Meta-analysis of this data led us to identify highly significant mutations in viral genomes. Correlation and Hierarchical Clustering of the highly significant mutations led us to the identification of sixteen mutation pairs that were correlated with each other and were present in >30% of the genomes under study. Among these mutation pairs, some of the mutations have been shown to contribute towards the viral replication and fitness suggesting the possible role of other unexplored mutations in viral evolution and pathogenesis. Additionally, we employed various computational tools to investigate the effects of T85I, P323L, and Q57H mutations in Non-structural protein 2 (Nsp2), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Open reading frame 3a (ORF3a) respectively. Results show that T85I in Nsp2 and Q57H in ORF3a mutations are deleterious and destabilize the parent protein whereas P323L in RdRp is neutral and has a stabilizing effect. The normalized linear mutual information (nLMI) calculations revealed the significant residue correlation in Nsp2 and ORF3a in contrast to reduce correlation in RdRp protein.	mutation_name: NSP12_P323L | effect: protein_stability | level: higher

79	10.3390/biom11070919	SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein is the target for the antiviral drug Remdesivir (RDV). With RDV clinical trials on COVID-19 patients showing a reduced hospitalisation time. During the spread of the virus, the RdRp has developed several mutations, with the most frequent being A97V and P323L. The current study sought to investigate whether A97V and P323L mutations influence the binding of RDV to the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 compared to wild-type (WT). The interaction of RDV with WT-, A97V-, and P323L-RdRp were measured using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and the free binding energies were extracted. Results showed that RDV that bound to WT- and A97V-RdRp had a similar dynamic motion and internal residue fluctuations, whereas RDV interaction with P323L-RdRp exhibited a tighter molecular conformation, with a high internal motion near the active site. This was further corroborated with RDV showing a higher binding affinity to P323L-RdRp (−24.1 kcal/mol) in comparison to WT-RdRp (−17.3 kcal/mol). This study provides insight into the potential significance of administering RDV to patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 P323L-RdRp mutation, which may have a more favourable chance of alleviating the SARS-CoV-2 illness in comparison to WT-RdRp carriers, thereby suggesting further scientific consensus for the usage of Remdesivir as clinical candidate against COVID-19.	mutation_name: NSP12_P323L | effect: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs | level: higher

CD8+ T-cell lines unable to recognise variant epitopes have diverse T-cell receptor repertoires. These data demonstrate the potential for T-cell evasion and highlight the need for ongoing surveillance for variants capable of escaping T-cell as well as humoral immunity.	mutation_name: N_P365S | effect: immune_escape | level: higher
0	10.1002/1873-3468.14076	Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) variants (B.1.1.7 and B.1351) have emerged harbouring mutations that make them highly contagious. The N501Y mutation within the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of these SARS‐CoV‐2 variants may enhance binding to the human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). However, no molecular explanation for such an enhanced affinity has so far been provided. Here, using all‐atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show that Y501 in the mutated RBD can be well‐coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, which may increase the overall binding affinity of the RBD for hACE2 by approximately 0.81 kcal·mol(−1). The binding dynamics revealed in our study may provide a working model to facilitate the design of more effective antibodies.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, SPIKE_N501Y
1	10.1002/advs.202105378	The SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta (B.1.617.2) strain is a variant of concern (VOC) that has become the dominant strain worldwide in 2021. Its transmission capacity is approximately twice that of the original strain, with a shorter incubation period and higher viral load during infection. Importantly, the breakthrough infections of the Delta variant have continued to emerge in the first‐generation vaccine recipients. There is thus an urgent need to develop a novel vaccine with SARS‐CoV‐2 variants as the major target. Here, receptor binding domain (RBD)‐conjugated nanoparticle vaccines targeting the Delta variant, as well as the early and Beta/Gamma strains, are developed. Under both a single‐dose and a prime‐boost strategy, these RBD‐conjugated nanoparticle vaccines induce the abundant neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and significantly protect hACE2 mice from infection by the authentic SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta strain, as well as the early and Beta strains. Furthermore, the elicitation of the robust production of broader cross‐protective NAbs against almost all the notable SARS‐CoV‐2 variants including the Omicron variant in rhesus macaques by the third re‐boost with trivalent vaccines is found. These results suggest that RBD‐based monovalent or multivalent nanoparticle vaccines provide a promising second‐generation vaccine strategy for SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2, BETA, GAMMA
2	10.1002/cbic.202100191	The evolution of new SARS‐CoV‐2 variants around the globe has made the COVID‐19 pandemic more worrisome, further pressuring the health care system and immunity. Novel variations that are unique to the receptor‐binding motif (RBM) of the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) spike glycoprotein, i. e. L452R‐E484Q, may play a different role in the B.1.617 (also known as G/452R.V3) variant's pathogenicity and better survival compared to the wild type. Therefore, a thorough analysis is needed to understand the impact of these mutations on binding with host receptor (RBD) and to guide new therapeutics development. In this study, we used structural and biomolecular simulation techniques to explore the impact of specific mutations (L452R‐E484Q) in the B.1.617 variant on the binding of RBD to the host receptor ACE2. Our analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic‐stability, residual flexibility and structural compactness. Moreover, the new variant had altered the bonding network and structural‐dynamics properties significantly. MM/GBSA technique was used, which further established the binding differences between the wild type and B.1.617 variant. In conclusion, this study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the new SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617, SPIKE_E484Q, SPIKE_L452R

From the analysis of a set of bonding descriptors firmly rooted in the formalism of quantum mechanics, including Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO), Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and highly correlated energies within the Domain Based Local Pair Natural Orbital Coupled Cluster Method (DLPNO‐CCSD(T)), and from a set of computed electronic spectral patterns with environmental effects, we show that the new variants improve their ability to recognize available sites to either hydrogen bond or to form salt bridges with residues in the ACE2 receptor of the host cells. This results in significantly improved initial virus⋅⋅⋅cell molecular recognition and attachment at the microscopic level, which trigger the infectious cycle.	mutation_name_list: B.1.160, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, P.2
4	10.1002/jmv.20707	SARS‐CoV is a newly identified coronavirus (CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important structural and functional protein. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the SARS‐CoV N protein and to elucidate the possible involvement of N protein in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis, a human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two‐hybrid system assay. hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of sumoylation system, was found to interact specifically with the N protein, implying the post‐translational sumoylation of the N protein. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170–210, which includes the SR‐rich motif. However, the consensus motif of sumoylation GK(62)EE in the N protein is not responsible for binding to hUbc9. Mutations of hUbc9 at the enzyme active site C93A or C93S severely impair the interaction with the N protein. The two proteins were also shown to colocalize in the cytoplasm of the transfected 293T cells. This is the first report demonstrating the interaction of hUbc9 with a structural protein of plus‐strand RNA viruses, indicating a new drug target for SARS‐CoV. J. Med.

5	10.1002/jmv.26417	Pandemic COVID‐19 outbreak has been caused due to SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogen, resulting millions of infection and death worldwide, USA being on top at the present moment. The long, complex orf1ab polyproteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 play an important role in viral RNA synthesis. To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134 complete protein sequences of orf1ab polyprotein from NCBI Virus database from affected patients across various states of USA from December 2019 to 25(th) April 2020. Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega followed by statistical significance was calculated. Four significant mutations T265I (nsp 2), P4715L (nsp 12) and P5828L and Y5865C (both at nsp 13) were identified in important non‐structural proteins, which function either as replicase or helicase. A comparative analysis shows 265T→I, 5828P→L and 5865Y→C are unique to USA and not reported from Europe or Asia; while one, 4715P→L is predominant in both Europe and USA. Mutational changes in amino acids are predicted to alter structure and function of corresponding proteins, thereby it is imperative to consider the mutational spectra while designing new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral orf1ab.

7	10.1002/jmv.27524	As the latest identified novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant of concern (VOC), the influence of Omicron on our globe grows promptly. Compared with the last VOC (Delta variant), more mutations were identified, which may address the characteristics of Omicron. Considering these crucial mutations and their implications including an increase in transmissibility, COVID-19 severity, and reduction of efficacy of currently available diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, Omicron has been classified as one of the VOC. Notably, 15 of these mutations reside in the receptor-binding domain of spike glycoprotein, which may alter transmissibility, infectivity, neutralizing antibody escape, and vaccine breakthrough cases of COVID-19. Therefore, our present study characterizes the mutational hotspots of the Omicron variant in comparison with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, detailed information was analyzed to characterize the global perspective of Omicron, including transmission dynamic, effect on testing, and immunity, which shall promote the progress of the clinical application and basic research. Collectively, our data suggest that due to continuous variation in the spike glycoprotein sequences, the use of coronavirus-specific attachment inhibitors may not be the current choice of therapy for emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Hence, we need to proceed with a sense of urgency in this matter.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON
8	10.1002/jmv.27526	Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially those of concern, may have an impact on the virus's transmissibility and pathogenicity, as well as diagnostic equipment performance and vaccine effectiveness. Even though the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) emerged during India's second wave of infections, Delta variants have grown dominant internationally and are still evolving. On November 26, 2021, WHO identified the variant B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern, naming it Omicron, based on evidence that Omicron contains numerous mutations that may influence its behaviour. However, the mode of transmission and severity of the Omicron variant remains unknown. We used computational studies to examine the Delta and Omicron variants in this work and found that the Omicron variant had a higher affinity for human ACE2 than the Delta variant due to a significant number of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, indicating a higher potential for transmission. Based on docking studies, the Q493R, N501Y, S371L, S373P, S375F, Q498R, and T478K mutations contribute significantly to high binding affinity with human ACE2. In comparison to the Delta variant, both the entire spike protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in Omicron include a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine. These amino acids are located within the protein's core and are required for structural stability. We observed a disorder-order transition in the Omicron variant between spike protein RBD regions 468-473, and it may be significant in the influence of disordered residues/regions on spike protein stability and binding to ACE2. A future study might investigate the epidemiological and biological consequences of the Omicron variant. This article is protected by copyright.

9	10.1002/jmv.27663	The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a threatening impact on a global scale, largely due to the emergence of newly SARS-CoV-2 variants. The Mu (PANGO lineage B.1.621), was first identified in Colombia in January 2021 and was classified as a variant of interest (VOI) in August 2021, due to a constellation of mutations that likely-mediate an unexpectedly enhanced immune resistance to inactivated vaccine-elicited antibodies. Despite if recently studies suggested that the Mu variant appear to have a less infectivity than the Delta variant, here we examined the structural effect of the Mu spike protein mutations and predicted the potential impact on infectivity of the Mu variant compared with the Delta and Delta plus spike protein.

10	10.1002/mco2.95	Several SARS‐CoV‐2 variants have emerged since the pandemic, bringing about a renewed threat to the public. Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was first detected in October 2020 in India and was characterized as variants of concern (VOC) by WHO on May 11, 2021. Delta variant rapidly outcompeted other variants to become the dominant circulating lineages due to its clear competitive advantage. There is emerging evidence of enhanced transmissibility and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Delta variant. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the features and phenotypic effects of this variant. Herein, we comprehensively described the evaluation and features of Delta variant, summarized the effects of mutations in spike on the infectivity, transmission ability, immune evasion, and provided a perspective on efficient approaches for preventing and overcoming COVID‐19.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2
11	10.1002/prot.26042	The human spike protein sequences from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania were analyzed by comparing with the reference severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) protein sequence from Wuhan‐Hu‐1, China. Out of 10333 spike protein sequences analyzed, 8155 proteins comprised one or more mutations. A total of 9654 mutations were observed that correspond to 400 distinct mutation sites. The receptor binding domain (RBD) which is involved in the interactions with human angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE‐2) receptor and causes infection leading to the COVID‐19 disease comprised 44 mutations that included residues within 3.2 Å interacting distance from the ACE‐2 receptor. The mutations observed in the spike proteins are discussed in the context of their distribution according to the geographical locations, mutation sites, mutation types, distribution of the number of mutations at the mutation sites and mutations at the glycosylation sites. The density of mutations in different regions of the spike protein sequence and location of the mutations in protein three‐dimensional structure corresponding to the RBD are discussed. The mutations identified in the present work are important considerations for antibody, vaccine, and drug development.	mutation_name_list:

Mutations in Spike could affect efficacy of those treatments. Hence, monitoring of mutations is necessary to forecast and readapt the inventory of therapeutics. Different phylogenetic nomenclatures have been used for the currently circulating SARS‐CoV‐2 clades. The Spike protein has different hotspots of mutation and deletion, the most dangerous for immune escape being the ones within the receptor binding domain (RBD), such as K417N/T, N439K, L452R, Y453F, S477N, E484K, and N501Y. Convergent evolution has led to different combinations of mutations among different clades.

13	10.1007/978-3-030-86582-5_1	COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Although a number of new vaccines are available to combat this threat, a high prevalence of novel mutant viral variants is observed in all world regions affected by this infection. Among viral proteomes, the highly glycosylated spike protein (Sprot) of SARS-CoV-2 has received the most attention due to its interaction with the host receptor ACE2. To understand the mechanisms of viral variant infectivity and the interaction of the RBD of Sprot with the host ACE2, we performed a large-scale mutagenesis study of the RBD-ACE2 interface by performing 1780 point mutations in silico and identifying the ambiguous stabilisation of the interface by the most common point mutations described in the literature. Furthermore, we pinpointed the N501Y mutation at the RBD of Sprot as profoundly affecting complex formation and confirmed greater stability of the N501Y mutant compared to wild-type (WT) viral S protein by molecular dynamics experiments. These findings could be important for the study and design of upcoming vaccines, PPI inhibitor molecules, and therapeutic antibodies or antibody mimics. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y
14	10.1007/s00253-021-11676-2	The progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has generated numerous emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 on a global scale. These variants have gained evolutionary advantages, comprising high virulence and serious infectivity due to multiple spike glycoprotein mutations. As a reason, variants are demonstrating significant abilities to escape the immune responses of the host. The D614G mutation in the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 variants has shown the most efficient interaction with the ACE2 receptor of the cells. This explicit mutation at amino acid position 614 (aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution) is the prime cause of infection and re-infection. It changes the conformation of RBD and cleavage patterns S-glycoprotein with higher stability, replication fitness, and fusion efficiencies. Therefore, this review aims to provide several crucial pieces of information associated with the D614 mutational occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their infectivity patterns. This review will also effectively emphasize the mechanism of action of D614G mutant variants, immune escape, and partial vaccine escape of this virus. Furthermore, the viral characteristic changes leading to the current global pandemic condition have been highlighted. Here, we have tried to illustrate a novel direction for future researchers to develop effective therapeutic approaches and counterweight strategies to minimize the spread of COVID-19. Key points • D614G mutation arises within the S-glycoprotein of significant SARS-CoV-2 variants. • The D614G mutation affects infection, re-infection, cleavage patterns of S-glycoprotein, and replication fitness of SARS-CoV-2 variants. • The D614G mutation influences the immunity and partial vaccine escape.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
15	10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.07.002	Certain genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 are of substantial concern because they may be more transmissible or detrimentally alter the pandemic course and disease features in individual patients. We report SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 12,476 patients in the Houston Methodist healthcare system diagnosed from January 1 through May 31, 2021. Prevalence of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant increased rapidly and caused 63%-90% of new cases in the latter half of May. Eleven B.1.1.7 genomes had an E484K replacement in spike protein, a change also identified in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Compared with non-B.1.1.7-infected patients, individuals with B.1.1.7 had a significantly lower cycle threshold (a proxy for higher virus load) and significantly higher hospitalization rate. Other variants (e.g., B.1.429 and B.1.427 (Epsilon), P.1 (Gamma), P.2 (Zeta), and R.1) also increased rapidly, although the magnitude was less than B.1.1.7. We identified 22 patients infected with B.1.617.1 (Kappa) or B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants; these patients had a high rate of hospitalization. Breakthrough cases (n=207) in fully vaccinated patients were caused by a heterogeneous array of virus genotypes, including many that are not currently designated variants of interest or concern. In the aggregate, our study delineates the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in a major metropolitan area, documents B.1.1.7 as the major cause of new cases in Houston, and heralds the arrival of B.1.617 variants in the metroplex.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2
16	10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.10.019	Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have repeatedly altered the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delta variants of concern are now the focus of intense international attention because they are causing widespread COVID-19 disease globally and are associated with vaccine breakthrough cases. We sequenced the genomes of 16,965 SARS-CoV-2 from samples acquired March 15, 2021 through September 20, 2021 in the Houston Methodist hospital system. This sample represents 91% of all Methodist system COVID-19 patients during the study period. Delta variants increased rapidly from late April onward to cause 99.9% of all COVID-19 cases and spread throughout the Houston metroplex. Compared to all other variants combined, Delta caused a significantly higher rate of vaccine breakthrough cases (23.7% for Delta compared to 6.6% for all other variants combined). Importantly, significantly fewer fully vaccinated individuals required hospitalization. Individuals with vaccine breakthrough cases caused by Delta had a low median PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value (a proxy for high virus load). This value was closely similar to the median Ct value for unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 caused by Delta variants, suggesting that fully vaccinated individuals can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. Patients infected with Alpha and Delta variants had several significant differences. Our integrated analysis emphasizes that vaccines used in the United States are highly effective in decreasing severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalizations, and deaths.	mutation_name_list: DELTA
17	10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.01.035	The recognition of ACE2 by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein mediates host cell entry. The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_G476S, SPIKE_V483A, SPIKE_A348T, SPIKE_V367F, SPIKE_S494P
18	10.1016/j.bbrep.2021.100933	Severe acquired respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) rapidly spread worldwide and acquired multiple mutations in its genome. Orf3a, an accessory protein encoded by the genome of SARS-CoV-2, plays a significant role in viral infection and pathogenesis. In the present in-silico study, 15,928 sequences of Orf3a reported worldwide were compared to identify variations in this protein. Our analysis revealed the occurrence of mutations at 173 residues of Orf3a protein. Subsequently, protein modelling was performed that revealed twelve mutations which can considerably affect the stability of Orf3a. Among the 12 mutations, three mutations (Y160H, D210Y and S171L) also lead to alterations in secondary structure and protein disorder parameters of the Orf3a protein. Further, we used predictive tools to identify five promising epitopes of B-cells, which resides in the mutated regions of Orf3a. Altogether, our study sheds light on the variations occurring in Orf3a that might contribute to alteration in protein structure and function.	mutation_name_list: ORF3A_Y160H, ORF3A_D210Y, ORF3A_S171L
19	10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.033	SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 2M deaths in little over a year. Vaccines are being deployed at scale, aiming to generate responses against the virus spike. The scale of the pandemic and error-prone virus replication is leading to the appearance of mutant viruses and potentially escape from antibody responses. Variant B.1.1.7, now dominant in the UK, with increased transmission, harbours 9 amino-acid changes in the spike, including N501Y in the ACE2 interacting-surface. We examine the ability of B.1.1.7 to evade antibody responses elicited by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We map the impact of N501Y by structure/function analysis of a large panel of well-characterised monoclonal antibodies. B.1.1.7 is harder to neutralize than parental virus, compromising neutralization by some members of a major class of public antibodies through light chain contacts with residue 501. However, widespread escape from monoclonal antibodies or antibody responses generated by natural infection or vaccination was not observed.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
20	10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110394	The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) raises concerns about potential reduced sensitivity of the virus to antibody neutralization and subsequent vaccine breakthrough infections. Here, we use a live virus neutralization assay with sera from Pfizer- and Moderna-vaccinated individuals to examine neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 and observe a 3.9- and 2.7-fold reduction, respectively, in neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant compared with an early isolate bearing only a D614G substitution in its spike protein. We observe similar reduced sensitivity with sera from hamsters that were previously infected with an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Despite this reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant, hamsters previously infected (up to 15 months earlier) with an early isolate are protected from infection with the Delta variant, suggesting that the immune response to the first infection is sufficient to provide protection against subsequent infection with the Delta variant.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2
21	10.1016/j.chom.2020.11.012	The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the pandemic that confers greater infectivity and is now the globally dominant form. To determine whether D614G might also mediate neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 spike. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by receptor binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera from people infected with either form of the virus. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed a higher percentage of the 1-RBD “up” conformation in the G614 spike, suggesting increased epitope exposure as a mechanism of enhanced vulnerability to neutralization. Based on these findings, the D614G mutation is not expected to be an obstacle for current vaccine development.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
22	10.1016/j.chom.2021.06.006	Many SARS-CoV-2 variants with naturally acquired mutations have emerged. These mutations can affect viral properties such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has been investigated, sensitivity to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cellular immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that two recently emerging mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429 and B.1.617) and Y453F (in B.1.1.298), confer escape from HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce affinity toward the host entry receptor ACE2. Notably, the L452R mutation increases spike stability, viral infectivity, viral fusogenicity, and thereby promotes viral replication. These data suggest that HLA-restricted cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes and that a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is escape from cellular immunity.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_L452R, SPIKE_Y453F
23	10.1016/j.cmi.2021.05.022	BACKGROUND: Many new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been termed Variants of Concern/Interest (VOC/I) because of their greater risk due to possibly: enhanced transmissibility and/or severity, immune escape, diagnostic and/or treatment failure, and reduced vaccine efficacy. OBJECTIVES: We sought to review current knowledge of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those deemed VOC/Is: B.1.351, B.1.1.7, and P.1. SOURCES: MEDLINE and BioRxiv databases, as well as the grey literature were searched for reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants since November 2020. Relevant articles and their references were screened. CONTENT: Mutations on the spike protein in particular may affect both affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor ACEII or antibody binding. These VOC/Is often share similar mutation sets. The N501Y mutation is shared by the main three VOCs: B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom; P.1, originating from Brazil; and B.1.351, first described in South Africa. This mutation likely increases transmissibility, by increasing affinity for ACEII. The B.1.351 and P.1 variants also display the E484K mutation, which decreases binding of neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, favoring reinfections, and decreased in vitro efficacy of some antibody therapies or vaccines. Those mutations may also have phenotypical repercussions of higher severity. Furthermore, the accumulation of mutations poses a diagnostic risk (lowered when using multiplex assays), as seen for some assays targeting the S-gene. With ongoing surveillance, many new VOC/Is have been identified. The emergence of the E484K mutation independently in different parts of the globe may reflect adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans in a background of increasing immunity. IMPLICATIONS: These VOC/Is are increasing in frequency globally and pose challenges to any herd immunity approach of managing the pandemic. While vaccination is ongoing, vaccine updates may be prudent. The virus continues to adapt to transmission in humans, and further divergence from the initial Wuhan sequences is expected.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_E484K
24	10.1016/j.cmi.2021.05.025	OBJECTIVES: Detection and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is of eminent importance, particularly due to the rapid emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). In this study we evaluated if commercially available quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay can identify SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage samples by a specific N gene dropout or Ct value shift compared to the S or RdRp gene. METHODS: VOC B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2-positive patient samples were identified via whole-genome sequencing and variant-specific PCR. Confirmed B.1.1.7 (n=48) and non-B.1.1.7 samples (n=58) were analysed using the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV™ PCR assay for presence of SARS-CoV-2 S, RdRp and N gene. N gene coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with and without D3L mutation (specific for B.1.1.7) was cloned into pCR®-TOPO vectors to validate polymorphism dependent N gene dropout with Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV™ PCR assay. RESULTS: All studied B.1.1.7-positive patient samples showed significantly higher Ct values in qRT-PCR (Δ 6-10, N gene dropout on Ct values >29) of N gene compared to the corresponding values of S (p ≤ 0.0001) and RdRp (p ≤ 0.0001) genes. The assay reliably discriminated B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 positive samples (area under the curve AUC = 1) in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Identical Ct shifts (Δ 7-10) were detected in reverse genetic experiments, using isolated plasmids containing N gene coding sequences corresponding to D3 or 3L variants. CONCLUSIONS: A N gene dropout or Ct value shift is shown for B.1.1.7-positive samples in the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV PCR assay. This approach can be used as a rapid tool for B.1.1.7 detection in single assay high throughput diagnostics.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
25	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104936	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Reports of new variants that potentially increase virulence and viral transmission, as well as reduce the efficacy of available vaccines, have recently emerged. In this study, we computationally analyzed the N439K, S477 N, and T478K variants for their ability to bind Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used the protein-protein docking approach to explore whether the three variants displayed a higher binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor than the wild type. We found that these variants alter the hydrogen bonding network and the cluster of interactions. Additional salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and a high number of non-bonded contacts (i.e., non-bonded interactions between atoms in the same molecule and those in other molecules) were observed only in the mutant complexes, allowing efficient binding to the ACE2 receptor. Furthermore, we used a 2.0-μs all-atoms simulation approach to detect differences in the structural dynamic features of the resulting protein complexes. Our findings revealed that the mutant complexes possessed stable dynamics, consistent with the global trend of mutations yielding variants with improved stability and enhanced affinity. Binding energy calculations based on molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) further revealed that electrostatic interactions principally increased net binding energies. The stability and binding energies of N439K, S477 N, and T478K variants were enhanced compared to the wild-type-ACE2 complex. The net binding energy of the systems was −31.86 kcal/mol for the wild-type-ACE2 complex, −67.85 kcal/mol for N439K, −69.82 kcal/mol for S477 N, and −69.64 kcal/mol for T478K. The current study provides a basis for exploring the enhanced binding abilities and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 variants to design novel therapeutics against the virus.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N439K, SPIKE_S477 N, SPIKE_T478K
26	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.105163	The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the host ACE2 receptor plays a vital role in the entry to the cell. Among which the hotspot residue 501 is continuously subjected to positive selection pressure and induces unusual virulence. Keeping in view the importance of the hot spot residue 501, we predicted the potentially emerging structural variants of 501 residue. We analyzed the binding pattern of wild type and mutants (Spike RBD) to the ACE2 receptor by deciphering variations in the amino acids’ interaction networks by graph kernels along with evolutionary, network metrics, and energetic information. Our analysis revealed that N501I, N501T, and N501V increase the binding affinity and alter the intra and inter-residue bonding networks. The N501T has shown strong positive selection and fitness in other animals. Docking results and repeated simulations (three times) confirmed the structural stability and tighter binding of these three variants, correlated with the previous results following the global stability trend. Consequently, we reported three variants N501I, N501T, and N501V could worsen the situation further if they emerged. The relations between the viral fitness and binding affinity is a complicated game thus the emergence of high affinity mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD brings up the question of whether or not positive selection favours these mutations or not?	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501I, SPIKE_N501T, SPIKE_N501V
27	10.1016/j.csbj.2022.01.017	The clinical manifestation of the recent pandemic COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, varies from mild to severe respiratory illness. Although environmental, demographic and co-morbidity factors have an impact on the severity of the disease, contribution of the mutations in each of the viral genes towards the degree of severity needs a deeper understanding for designing a better therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Open Reading Frame-3a (ORF3a) protein has been found to be mutated at several positions. In this work, we have studied the effect of one of the most frequently occurring mutants, D155Y of ORF3a protein, found in Indian COVID-19 patients. Using computational simulations we demonstrated that the substitution at 155th changed the amino acids involved in salt bridge formation, hydrogen-bond occupancy, interactome clusters, and the stability of the protein compared with the other substitutions found in Indian patients. Protein–protein docking using HADDOCK analysis revealed that substitution D155Y weakened the binding affinity of ORF3a with caveolin-1 compared with the other substitutions, suggesting its importance in the overall stability of ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex, which may modulate the virulence property of SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name_list: ORF3A_D155Y
28	10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2021.115491	OBJECTIVES: : To compare the RT-PCR Allplex SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV Assay (Allplex assay) with other methods of detection of VOC B.1.1.7. METHODS: : Suspected and non-suspected cases of VOC B.1.1.7 were defined according to the VirSNiP assay, which detects N501Y and deletion H69-V70. For pre-screening, the Allplex™ and TaqPath assays were used. RESULTS: : One hundred and sixteen suspected and 113 non-suspected cases were included. In the suspected cases, the Allplex assay showed N-gene dropout, or delayed Ct values of 6.27±1.21 and 6.66±1.41 compared with those of the RdRP and S-gene target, respectively. Agreement between the Allplex and TaqPath assays was 100% when the RdRP and S-gene targets had Ct values <35. Agreement between the Allplex and VirSNiP assays was 100% with Ct value <30. CONCLUSIONS: : The Allplex assay showed excellent agreement with the current pre-screening method for VOC B.1.1.7. In addition, its automated processing enhances the feasibility of widespread use in laboratories.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
29	10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103997	BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is rampantly spreading across the globe. We assessed the pathogenicity and immune response generated by BA.1.1 sub-lineage of SARS-CoV-2 [Omicron (R346K) variant] in 5 to 6-week old Syrian hamsters and compared the observations with that of Delta variant infection. METHODS: Virus shedding, organ viral load, lung disease and immune response generated in hamsters were sequentially assessed. FINDINGS: The disease characteristics of the Omicron (R346K) variant were found to be similar to that of the Delta variant infection in hamsters like viral replication in the respiratory tract and interstitial pneumonia. The Omicron (R346K) infected hamsters demonstrated lesser body weight reduction and viral RNA load in the throat swab and nasal wash samples in comparison to the Delta variant infection. The viral load in the lungs and nasal turbinate samples and the lung disease severity of the Omicron (R346K) infected hamsters were found comparable with that of the Delta variant infected hamsters. Neutralizing antibody response against Omicron (R346K) variant was detected from day 5 and the cross-neutralization titre of the sera against other variants showed severe reduction ie., 7 fold reduction against Alpha and no titers against B.1, Beta and Delta. INTERPRETATION: This preliminary data shows that Omicron (R346K) variant infection can produce moderate to severe lung disease similar to that of the Delta variant and the neutralizing antibodies produced in response to Omicron (R346K) variant infection shows poor neutralizing ability against other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants like Delta which necessitates caution as it may lead to increased cases of reinfection.

30	10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.101129	BACKGROUND: A novel variant of SARS-CoV-2, the Delta variant of concern (VOC, also known as lineage B.1.617.2), is fast becoming the dominant strain globally. We reported the epidemiological, viral, and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients infected with the Delta VOC during the local outbreak in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: We extracted the epidemiological and clinical information pertaining to the 159 cases infected with the Delta VOC across seven transmission generations between May 21 and June 18, 2021. The whole chain of the Delta VOC transmission was described. Kinetics of viral load and clinical characteristics were compared with a cohort of wild-type infection in 2020 admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. FINDINGS: There were four transmission generations within the first ten days. The Delta VOC yielded a significantly shorter incubation period (4.0 vs. 6.0 days), higher viral load (20.6 vs. 34.0, cycle threshold of the ORF1a/b gene), and a longer duration of viral shedding in pharyngeal swab samples (14.0 vs. 8.0 days) compared with the wild-type strain. In cases with critical illness, the proportion of patients over the age of 60 was higher in the Delta VOC group than in the wild-type strain (100.0% vs. 69.2%, p = 0.03). The Delta VOC had a higher risk than wild-type infection in deterioration to critical status (hazards ratio 2.98 [95%CI 1.29-6.86]; p = 0.01). INTERPRETATION: Infection with the Delta VOC is characterized by markedly increased transmissibility, viral loads and risk of disease progression compared with the wild-type strain, calling for more intensive prevention and control measures to contain future outbreaks.

31	10.1016/j.envres.2021.111653	Less than a year following the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, variants of concern have emerged in the form of variant Alpha (B.1.1.7, the British variant) and Beta (B.1.351, the South Africa variant). Due to their high infectivity and morbidity, it has become clear that it is crucial to quickly and effectively detect these and other variants. Here, we report improved primers-probe sets for reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 detection including a rapid, cost-effective, and direct RT-qPCR method for detection of the two variants of concern (Alpha, B.1.1.7 and Beta, B.1.351). All the developed primers-probe sets were fully characterized, demonstrating sensitive and specific detection. These primer-probe sets were also successfully employed on wastewater samples aimed at detecting and even quantifying new variants in a geographical area, even prior to the reports by the medical testing. The novel primers-probe sets presented here will enable proper responses for pandemic containment, particularly considering the emergence of variants of concern.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351
32	10.1016/j.genrep.2020.100997	The ongoing mutations in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the major impediment for prevention and control of the COVID-19 disease. Presently we focused on evolution of the envelope (E) protein, one of the most enigmatic and less studied protein among the four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) associated with multitude of immunopathological functions of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed 81,818 high quality E protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 globally available in the GISAID database as of 20 August 2020. Compared to Wuhan reference strain, our mutational analysis explored only 1.2 % (982/81818) mutant strains undergoing a total of 115 unique amino acid (aa) substitutions in the E protein, highlighting the fact that most (98.8 %) of the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 strains are highly conserved. Moreover, we found 58.77 % (134 of 228) nucleotides (nt) positions of SARS-CoV-2 E gene encountering a total of 176 unique nt-level mutations globally, which may affect the efficacy of real time RT-PCR-based molecular detection of COVID-19. Importantly, higher aa variations observed in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the E protein, particularly at Ser(55)-Phe(56), Arg(69) and the C-terminal end (DLLV: 72–75) may alter the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Envelope protein to tight junction-associated PALS1 and thus could play a key role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Furthermore, this study revealed the V25A mutation in the transmembrane domain which is a key factor for the homopentameric conformation of E protein. Our analysis also observed a triple cysteine motif harboring mutation (L39M, A41S, A41V, C43F, C43R, C43S, C44Y, N45R) which may hinder the binding of E protein with spike glycoprotein. These results therefore suggest the continuous monitoring of the structural proteins including the envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 since the number of genome sequences from across the world are continuously increasing.	mutation_name_list: E_V25A
33	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.08.003	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate changes in COVID-19 patients' characteristics occurring after the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) P.1 (Gamma) by comparing the clinical, demographic and laboratory profile of patients hospitalized during the first (May-July 2020) and second (December 2020 - February 2021) pandemic waves. METHODS: Data was collected from records of COVID-19 patients (n=4164) admitted to a single hospital in Salvador, Northeast Brazil. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was performed in nasopharyngeal swab samples from 12 patients with age < 60 years-old admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) in February 2021. RESULTS: From June 2020 to February 2021, the median age of patients admitted in the ICU decreased from 66 to 58 years (p<0.05), accompanied by an increased proportion of patients without comorbidities (15.32% vs 32.20%, p<0.0001). A significant reduction in the Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests was observed in the second wave (p<0.0001). Sequencing analysis detected lineage Gamma in all 12 ICU patients sampled in February 2021. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated an increased proportion of younger adults without comorbidities with severe disease during the second COVID-19 wave, shortly after the confirmation of local Gamma circulation.	mutation_name_list: P.1
34	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.11.006	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic. Additionally, several SARS-CoV-2 variants have continuously challenged diagnostic testing due to viral diversity in spike and nucleocapsid (N) protein mutations. SARS-CoV-2-variant proliferation potentially affects N protein-targeted rapid antigen testing. We performed rapid antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests simultaneously in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To determine the N protein variations, direct whole-genome sequencing was performed, and the viral assemblies were uploaded to GISAID. We compared their genomes with those of global virus strains from GISAID. These isolates belonged to the B.1.1.7 variant, exhibiting several amino acid substitutions, including D3L, R203K, G204R, and S235F N protein mutations. We also identified the T135I mutation in one variant case in which rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests were discordantly negative and positive, respectively. Our findings suggest that the variants undetected by the PanbioTM COVID-19 rapid antigen test may be due to N-protein T135I mutations, posing a potential diagnostic risk to commercially available antigen tests. Hence, we recommend concomitant paired rapid antigen tests and molecular diagnostic methods to detect SARS-CoV-2. False-negative results could be rapidly corrected using confirmatory RT-PCR results to prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks.	mutation_name_list: N_T135I
35	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.12.326	Objectives This study aims to explore the association between the molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 and disease severity on ambulatory and hospitalized patients in two main Colombian epicenters during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We included 1000 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected clinical data from 997, and obtained 678 whole genome sequences by massively parallel sequencing. Bivariate, multivariate, and classification and regression tree analyses were run between clinical and genomic variables. Results Age and infection with lineages B.1.1, B.1.1.388, B.1.523, and B.1.621 were related to lethality for patients 71-88 years old (OR: 6.048036; 95% CI 1.346567-32.92521, p-value: 0.01718674). The need for hospitalization was associated with higher age and comorbidities. For patients 38-51 years old infected with lineages A, B, B.1.1.388, B.1.1.434, B.1.153, B.1.36.10, B.1.411, B.1.471, B.1.558 or B.1.621, hospitalization rate increased significantly (OR 8.368427, 95% CI 2.573145-39.10672, p-value: 0.00012). Associations between clades and clinical outcomes diverged from previously reported data. Conclusions Lineage B.1.621 increased the need for hospitalization and lethality. Our findings, plus the rapidly increasing prevalence in Colombia and other countries, suggest broadly considering it as a Variant of Interest. If associated disease severity is confirmed, possible designation as Variant of Concern could be entertained.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1, B.1.1.388, B.1.523, B.1.621, A, B, B.1.1.434, B.1.153, B.1.36.10, B.1.411, B.1.471, B.1.558
36	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.12.362	The Delta variant of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2 has become dominant worldwide. We report here a cluster caused by B.1.617.2 harboring the additional mutation of concern (MOC) F490S. Infection occurred in 5 fully vaccinated subjects between the ages of 47 and 84. The immune escape mutation F490S, first identified in the Lambda VOI, appears to impair vaccine efficacy and is rapidly increasing in prevalence worldwide.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_F490S
37	10.1016/j.ijid.2022.03.001	The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strain emergence raised concerns that its enhanced infectivity is partly due to altered spread/contamination modalities. We therefore sampled high-contact surfaces and air in close proximity to patients verified as infected with Omicron strain, using identical protocols applied to sample patients positive to the original or Alpha strains. Cumulatively, for all three strains, viral-RNA was detected in 90/168 surfaces and 6/49 air samples (mean Ct=35.2±2.5). No infective virus was identified. No significant differences in prevalence were found between strains	mutation_name_list: OMICRON
38	10.1016/j.immuni.2021.03.023	Interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the receptor ACE2 on host cells is essential for viral entry. RBD is the dominant target for neutralizing antibodies, and several neutralizing epitopes on RBD have been molecularly characterized. Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD, N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 subunits of Spike. To understand how these mutations affect Spike antigenicity, we isolated and characterized >100 monoclonal antibodies targeting epitopes on RBD, NTD, and S2 from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Approximately 45% showed neutralizing activity, of which ∼20% were NTD specific. NTD-specific antibodies formed two distinct groups: the first was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred neutralization resistance to NTD-specific antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes should be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
39	10.1016/j.intimp.2021.108424	SARS-CoV2 mutants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 contain a key mutation N501Y. B.1.135 and P.1 lineages have another mutation, E484K. Here, we decode the effect of these two mutations on the host receptor, ACE2, and neutralizing antibody (B38) recognition. The N501Y RBD mutant binds to ACE2 with higher affinity due to improved π-π stacking and π-cation interactions. The higher binding affinity of the E484K mutant is caused due to the formation of additional hydrogen bond and salt-bridge interactions with ACE2. Both the mutants bind to the B38 antibody with reduced affinity due to the loss of several hydrogen-bonding interactions. The insights obtained from the study are crucial to interpret the increased transmissibility and reduced neutralization efficacy of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV2 VOCs.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_E484K
40	10.1016/j.isci.2021.102257	Viruses interact extensively with the host molecular machinery, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Bacteriophage T7 recruits the small protein thioredoxin of the Escherichia coli host as an essential processivity factor for the viral DNA polymerase. We challenged the phage to propagate in a host in which thioredoxin had been extensively modified to hamper its recruitment. The virus adapted to the engineered host without losing the capability to propagate in the original host, but no genetic mutations were fixed in the thioredoxin binding domain of the viral DNA polymerase. Virus adaptation correlated with mutations in the viral RNA polymerase, supporting that promiscuous thioredoxin recruitment was enabled by phenotypic mutations caused by transcription errors. These results point to a mechanism of virus adaptation that may play a role in cross-species transmission. We propose that phenotypic mutations may generally contribute to the capability of viruses to evade antiviral strategies.	mutation_name_list: 
41	10.1016/j.isci.2021.103353	We identify amino acid variants within dominant SARS-CoV-2 T-cell epitopes by interrogating global sequence data. Several variants within nucleocapsid and ORF3a epitopes have arisen independently in multiple lineages and result in loss of recognition by epitope-specific T-cells assessed by IFN-γ and cytotoxic killing assays. Complete loss of T-cell responsiveness was seen due to Q213K in the A*01:01-restricted CD8+ ORF3a epitope FTSDYYQLY207-215, due to P13L, P13S and P13T in the B*27:05-restricted CD8+ nucleocapsid epitope QRNAPRITF9-17, and due to T362I and P365S in the A*03:01/A*11:01-restricted CD8+ nucleocapsid epitope KTFPPTEPK361-369. CD8+ T-cell lines unable to recognise variant epitopes have diverse T-cell receptor repertoires. These data demonstrate the potential for T-cell evasion and highlight the need for ongoing surveillance for variants capable of escaping T-cell as well as humoral immunity.	mutation_name_list: ORF3A_Q213K, N_P13L, N_P13S, N_P13T, N_T362I, N_P365S
42	10.1016/j.isci.2021.103467	Since their identification, SARS-CoV-2 Kappa and Delta have rapidly spread to become globally dominant. However, their infectivity and sensitivity to administered vaccines have not been documented. We monitored neutralization potential of convalescent or BNT162b2-post-vaccination sera against Kappa and Delta SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We show that both variants were successfully neutralized by convalescent and post-vaccination sera, exhibiting a mild decrease in their neutralization sensitivity. Of the two variants, Delta presented enhanced infectivity levels compared to Kappa or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, both variants were not as infectious or resistant to post-vaccination sera as the Beta variant of concern. Interestingly, the Delta plus variant (AY.1/B.1.617.2.1) exhibited high resistance to post-vaccination sera, similar to that of the Beta SARS-CoV-2. However, its infectivity levels were close to those of wild-type SARS-CoV2. These results account for the worldwide prevalence of Delta variant of concern, and confirm the efficacy of the BNT162b2-vaccine against circulating other Delta variants.	mutation_name_list: DELTA, KAPPA, BETA, AY.1
43	10.1016/j.isci.2021.103589	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha), a WHO variant of concern (VOC) first identified in the UK in late 2020, contains several mutations including P681H in the spike S1/S2 cleavage site, which is predicted to increase cleavage by furin, potentially impacting the viral cell entry. Here, we studied the role of the P681H mutation in B.1.1.7 cell entry. We performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.1.7 S1/S2 sequence and observed no significant difference in furin cleavage. Functional assays using pseudoparticles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spikes and cell-to-cell fusion assays demonstrated no differences between Wuhan-Hu-1, B.1.1.7 or a P681H point mutant. Likewise, we observed no differences in viral growth between USA-WA1/2020 and a B.1.1.7 isolate in cell culture. Our findings suggest that while the B.1.1.7 P681H mutation may slightly increase S1/S2 cleavage this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_P681H, B.1.1.7
44	10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102715	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly evolving in the form of new variants. At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (≥20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (≥20 %) than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.	mutation_name_list: AY.1
45	10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102779	Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been emerging in the form of different variants since its first emergence in early December 2019. A new Variant of Concern (VOC) named the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was reported recently. This variant has a large number of mutations in the S protein. To date, there exists a limited information on the Omicron variant. Here we present the analyses of mutation distribution, the evolutionary relationship of Omicron with previous variants, and probable structural impact of mutations on antibody binding. Our analyses show the presence of 46 high prevalence mutations specific to Omicron. Twenty-three of these are localized within the spike (S) protein and the rest localized to the other 3 structural proteins of the virus, the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Omicron is closely related to the Gamma (P.1) variant. The structural analyses showed that several mutations are localized to the region of the S protein that is the major target of antibodies, suggesting that the mutations in the Omicron variant may affect the binding affinities of antibodies to the S protein.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.529
46	10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104900	More than one year into a global pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 is now defined by a variety of rapidly evolving variant lineages. Several FDA authorized molecular diagnostic tests have been impacted by viral variation, while no reports of viral variation affecting antigen test performance have occurred to date. While determining the analytical sensitivity of the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2), we uncovered a high viral load specimen that repeatedly tested negative by this antigen test. Whole genome sequencing of the specimen uncovered two mutations, T205I and D399N, present in the nucleocapsid protein of the isolate. All six SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens available in our laboratory with a D399N nucleocapsid mutation and C(T) < 31 were not detected by the Sofia 2 but detected by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, while clinical specimens with the T205I mutation were detected by both assays. Testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid with these variants demonstrated an approximate 1000-fold loss in sensitivity for the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test associated with the D399N mutation, while the BinaxNOW and Quidel Quickvue SARS Antigen tests were unaffected by the mutation. The D399N nucleocapsid mutation has been relatively uncommon to date, appearing in only 0.02% of genomes worldwide at time of writing. Our results demonstrate how routine pathogen genomics can be integrated into the clinical microbiology laboratory to investigate diagnostic edge cases, as well as the importance of profiling antigenic diversity outside of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.	mutation_name_list: N_D399N, E_T205I
47	10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104906	OBJECTIVES: : The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC), B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, with increased transmission and/or immune evasion, emphasise the need for broad and rapid variant monitoring. Our high-volume laboratory introduced a PCR variant assay (Variant PCR) in January 2021 based on the protocol by Vogels et al. STUDY DESIGN: : To assess whether Variant PCR could be used for rapid B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 screening, all positive SARS-CoV-2 airway samples were prospectively tested in parallel using both the Variant PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: : In total 1,642 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from individual patients were tested within a time span of 4 weeks. For all samples with valid results from both Variant PCR and WGS, no VoC was missed by Variant PCR (totalling 399 VoC detected). Conversely, all of the samples identified as “other lineages” (i.e., “non-VoC lineages”) by the Variant PCR, were confirmed by WGS. CONCLUSIONS: : The Variant PCR based on the protocol by Vogels et al., is an effective method for rapid screening for VoC, applicable for most diagnostic laboratories within a pandemic setting. WGS is still required to confirm the identity of certain variants and for continuous surveillance of emerging VoC.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1
48	10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101773	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world jeopardizing the global economy and health. The rapid proliferation and infectivity of the virus can be attributed to many accumulating mutations in the spike protein leading to continuous generation of variants. The spike protein is a glycoprotein that recognizes and binds to cell surface receptor known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) leading to the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes and entry into the host cells. These circulating variants in the population have greatly impacted the virulence, transmissibility, and immunological evasion of the host. The present study is aimed at understanding the impact of the major mutations (L452R, T478K and N501Y) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and their consequences on the binding affinity to human ACE2 through protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. Protein-protein docking and Molecular mechanics with generalised Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) binding free energy analysis reveal that the spike mutants-L452R, T478K and N501Y have a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 as compared to the native spike protein. The increase in the number of interface residues, interface area and intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and non-bonded contacts corroborated with the increase in the binding affinity of the spike mutants to ACE2. Further, 75 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulation investigations show variations in the geometric properties such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), total solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and number of hydrogen bonds (NHBs) in the mutant spike:ACE2 complexes with respect to the native spike:ACE2 complex. Therefore, the findings of this study unravel plausible molecular mechanisms of increase in binding affinity of spike mutants (L452R, T478K and N501Y) to human ACE2 leading to higher virulence and infectivity of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The study will further aid in designing novel therapeutics targeting the interface residues between spike protein and ACE2 receptor.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_L452R, SPIKE_T478K, SPIKE_N501Y
49	10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114428	BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended RT-qPCR tests as the reference technique for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection, however with the rapid spread of the infection, mutations in specific RT-qPCR target regions have been widely described could allow the presumptive identification. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the analytical performance of the Allplex™SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay for the additional presumptive identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a real-life setting. RESULTS: We observed gene-specific changes in the cycle threshold (Ct) of the N and RdRp genes compared with the Ct yielded for the S gene when the SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed Allplex™SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay. Seventeen samples showed Ct variations in the N and/or RdRp. In 10 cases, the N gene was affected, delayed or negative and in 14 cases, the RdRp gene showed a delay or negative concerning the S gene. A delay in the Ct of both genes (RdRp and N) was observed in six cases. Sequencing determined that all samples identified as B.1.1.7 showed changes in the PCR curves of the N and RdRp. However, samples identified as B.1.177 only showed variations for the RdRp gene. CONCLUSIONS: Allplex™SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay, the diagnosis could presumably allow the rapid assignment of lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.177, and emphasizes the importance of exhaustive surveillance for circulating variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to reduce community transmission.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.177
50	10.1016/j.medidd.2021.100086	SARS-CoV-2 is a global challenge due to its ability to spread much faster than the SARS-CoV, which was attributed to the mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD). These mutations enhanced the electrostatic interactions. Recently, a new strain is reported in the UK that includes a mutation (N501Y) in the RBD, that is possibly increasing the infection rate. Here, using Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, we show that the N501 mutation enhanced the electrostatic interactions due to the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between SARS-CoV-2-T500 and ACE2-D355 near the mutation site. In addition, we observed that the electrostatic interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the wild type and the mutant are dominated by salt-bridges formed between SARS-CoV-2-K417 and ACE2-D30, SARS-CoV-2-K458, ACE2-E23, and SARS-CoV-2-R403 and ACE2-E37. These interactions contributed more than 40% of the total binding energies.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y
51	10.1016/j.medj.2022.03.004	Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has proven highly transmissible and has outcompeted the Delta variant in many regions of the world. Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Methods Hamsters were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Animals were followed for weight loss, and upper and lower respiratory tract tissues were assessed for viral loads and histopathology. Findings Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10-17% weight loss by day 6. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts but demonstrated lower viral loads in lung parenchyma and reduced pulmonary pathology compared with WA1/2020 infection. Conclusions These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in robust upper respiratory tract infection but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants. Funding Funding for this study was provided by NIH grant CA260476, the Massachusetts Consortium for Pathogen Readiness, the Ragon Institute, and the Musk Foundation.	mutation_name_list: ALPHA, BETA, DELTA, B.1.1.529
52	10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104815	The D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein emerged in early 2020 and quickly became the dominant circulating strain in Europe and its environs. The variant was characterized by the higher viral load, which is not associated with disease severity, higher incorporation into the virion, and high cell entry via ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. Previous strains of the coronavirus and the current SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated the selection of mutations as a mechanism of escaping immune responses. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding energy analysis to provide insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and describe the neutralization mechanism of this variant. Our results show that the D614G S-protein adopts distinct conformational dynamics which is skewed towards the open-state conformation more than the closed-state conformation of the wild-type S-protein. Residue-specific variation of amino acid flexibility and domain-specific RMSD suggest that the mutation causes an allosteric conformational change in the RBD. Evaluation of the interaction energies between the S-protein and neutralizing antibodies show that the mutation may enhance, reduce or not affect the neutralizing interactions depending on the neutralizing antibody, especially if it targets the RBD. The results of this study have shed insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and provided a glimpse of the neutralization mechanism of this variant.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
53	10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104941	The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected millions of people since its beginning in 2019. The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020, the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October 2020, more than 40% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P.1, P.2 and B.1.1.33 - posteriorly renamed as N.9) in four Brazilian regions. We also evaluated the presence of E484K associated mutations and identified selective pressures acting on the spike protein, leading us to some insights about adaptive and purifying selection driving the virus evolution.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_E484K
54	10.1016/j.meegid.2021.105092	OBJECTIVES: To compare the demographics, clinical characteristics and severity of patients infected with nine different SARS-CoV-2 variants, during three phases of the COVID-19 epidemic in Marseille. METHODS: A single centre retrospective cohort study was conducted in 1760 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of Nextstrain clades 20A, 20B, and 20C (first phase, February–May 2020), Pangolin lineages B.1.177 (we named Marseille-2) and B.1.160 (Marseille-4) variants (second phase, June–December 2020), and B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and A.27 (Marseille-501) variants (third phase, January 2021-today). Outcomes were the occurrence of clinical failures, including hospitalisation, transfer to the intensive-care unit, and death. RESULTS: During each phase, no major differences were observed with regards to age and gender distribution, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and clinical symptoms between variants circulating in a given phase. The B.1.177 and B.1.160 variants were associated with more severe outcomes. Infections occurring during the second phase were associated with a higher rate of death as compared to infections during the first and third phases. Patients in the second phase were more likely to be hospitalised than those in the third phase. Patients infected during the third phase were more frequently obese than others. CONCLUSION: A large cohort study is recommended to evaluate the transmissibility and to better characterise the clinical severity of emerging variants.	mutation_name_list: B.1.177, B.1.160
55	10.1016/j.meegid.2022.105279	As surges of the COVID-19 pandemic continue globally, including in Palestine, several new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been introduced. This expansion has impacted transmission, disease severity, virulence, diagnosis, therapy, and natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Here, 183 whole genome sequences (WGS) were analyzed, of which 129 were from Palestinian cases, 62 of which were collected in 11 Palestinian districts between October 2020 and April 2021and sequenced completely . A dramatic shift from the wild type to the Alpha variant (B 1.1.7) was observed within a short period of time. Cluster mapping revealed statistically significant clades in two main Palestinian cities, Al-Khalil (Monte Carlo hypothesis test-Poisson model, P = 0.00000000012) and Nablus (Monte Carlo hypothesis test-Poisson model, P = 0.014 and 0.015). The phylogenetic tree showed three main clusters of SARS-CoV-2 with high bootstrap values (>90). However, population genetics analysis showed a genetically homogenous population supported by low Wright's F-statistic values (Fst <0.25), high gene flow (Nm > 3), and statistically insignificant Tajima's D values (Tajima's test, neutrality model prediction, P = 0.02). The Alpha variant, rapidly replaced the wild type, causing a major surge that peaked in April 2021, with an increased COVID-19 mortality rate, especially, in the Al-Khalil and Nablus districts. The source of introduction remains uncertain, despite the minimal genetic variation. The study substantiates the use of WGS for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance as an early warning system to track down new variants requiring effective control.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
56	10.1016/j.molcel.2022.03.028	Aided by extensive spike protein mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant overtook the previously dominant Delta variant. Spike conformation plays an essential role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution via changes in receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralizing antibody epitope presentation affecting virus transmissibility and immune evasion. Here, we determine cryo-EM structures of the Omicron and Delta spikes to understand the conformational impacts of mutations in each. The Omicron spike structure revealed an unusually tightly packed RBD organization with long range impacts that were not observed in the Delta spike. Binding and crystallography revealed increased flexibility at the functionally critical fusion peptide site in the Omicron spike. These results reveal a highly evolved Omicron spike architecture with possible impacts on its high levels of immune evasion and transmissibility.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON
57	10.1016/j.virol.2021.06.009	The fall of 2020 brought several new variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating across the globe, and the steadily increasing COVID-19 cases are responsible for the emergence of these variants. All the SARS-CoV-2 variants reported to date have multiple mutations in the spike (S) protein, specifically in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we employed an integrated computational approach involving structure and sequence based predictions to study the effect of naturally occurring variations in the S-RBD on its stability and ACE2 binding affinity. The hotspot stabilizing residue mutations N501I, N501Y, Q493L, Q493H and K417R, strengthen the RBD-ACE2 complex by modulating the interaction statistics at the interface. Thus, we report here some critical mutations that could increase the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2, increasing the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Understanding the effect of these mutations will help in developing potential vaccines and therapeutics.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501I, SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_Q493L, SPIKE_Q493H, SPIKE_K417R
58	10.1016/s0140-6736(22)00327-0	BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, omicron, appears to be less severe than delta. We aim to quantify the differences in symptom prevalence, risk of hospital admission, and symptom duration among the vaccinated population. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we collected data from participants who were self-reporting test results and symptoms in the ZOE COVID app (previously known as the COVID Symptoms Study App). Eligible participants were aged 16–99 years, based in the UK, with a body-mass index between 15 and 55 kg/m(2), had received at least two doses of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, were symptomatic, and logged a positive symptomatic PCR or lateral flow result for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. The primary outcome was the likelihood of developing a given symptom (of the 32 monitored in the app) or hospital admission within 7 days before or after the positive test in participants infected during omicron prevalence compared with those infected during delta prevalence. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2021, and Jan 17, 2022, we identified 63 002 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and reported symptoms in the ZOE app. These patients were matched 1:1 for age, sex, and vaccination dose, across two periods (June 1 to Nov 27, 2021, delta prevalent at >70%; n=4990, and Dec 20, 2021, to Jan 17, 2022, omicron prevalent at >70%; n=4990). Loss of smell was less common in participants infected during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (16·7% vs 52·7%, odds ratio [OR] 0·17; 95% CI 0·16–0·19, p<0·001). Sore throat was more common during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (70·5% vs 60·8%, 1·55; 1·43–1·69, p<0·001). There was a lower rate of hospital admission during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (1·9% vs 2·6%, OR 0·75; 95% CI 0·57–0·98, p=0·03). INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of symptoms that characterise an omicron infection differs from those of the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant, apparently with less involvement of the lower respiratory tract and reduced probability of hospital admission. Our data indicate a shorter period of illness and potentially of infectiousness which should impact work–health policies and public health advice.

59	10.1016/s1473-3099(21)00170-5	BACKGROUND: Emergence of variants with specific mutations in key epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 raises concerns pertinent to mass vaccination campaigns and use of monoclonal antibodies. We aimed to describe the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC), including virological characteristics and clinical severity in contemporaneous patients with and without the variant. METHODS: In this cohort study, samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR that were collected from Nov 9, 2020, for patients acutely admitted to one of two hospitals on or before Dec 20, 2020, in London, UK, were sequenced and analysed for the presence of VOC-defining mutations. We fitted Poisson regression models to investigate the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease (defined as point 6 or higher on the WHO ordinal scale within 14 days of symptoms or positive test) and death within 28 days of a positive test and did supplementary genomic analyses in a cohort of chronically shedding patients and in a cohort of remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load was compared by proxy, using PCR cycle threshold values and sequencing read depths. FINDINGS: Of 496 patients with samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR and who met inclusion criteria, 341 had samples that could be sequenced. 198 (58%) of 341 had B.1.1.7 infection and 143 (42%) had non-B.1.1.7 infection. We found no evidence of an association between severe disease and death and lineage (B.1.1.7 vs non-B.1.1.7) in unadjusted analyses (prevalence ratio [PR] 0·97 [95% CI 0·72–1·31]), or in analyses adjusted for hospital, sex, age, comorbidities, and ethnicity (adjusted PR 1·02 [0·76–1·38]). We detected no B.1.1.7 VOC-defining mutations in 123 chronically shedding immunocompromised patients or in 32 remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load by proxy was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold value (mean 28·8 [SD 4·7] vs 32·0 [4·8]; p=0·0085) and genomic read depth (1280 [1004] vs 831 [682]; p=0·0011). INTERPRETATION: Emerging evidence exists of increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7, and we found increased virus load by proxy for B.1.1.7 in our data. We did not identify an association of the variant with severe disease in this hospitalised cohort.

60	10.1016/s2213-2600(22)00045-5	BACKGROUND: Reports have suggested that the efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant replaced the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant as the predominant variant. We aimed to investigate, for the two main classes of vaccine, whether efficacy against severe COVID-19 has decreased since delta became the predominant variant and whether the efficacy of two doses of vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes with time since second dose. METHODS: In the REACT-SCOT case-control study, vaccine efficacy was estimated using a matched case-control design that includes all diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Scotland up to Sept 8, 2021. For every incident case of COVID-19 in the Scottish population, ten controls matched for age rounded to the nearest year, sex, and primary care practice, and alive on the day of presentation of the case that they were matched to were selected using the Community Health Index database. To minimise ascertainment bias we prespecified the primary outcome measure to assess vaccine efficacy as severe COVID-19, defined as diagnosed patients with entry to critical care within 21 days of first positive test, death within 28 days of first positive test, or any death for which COVID-19 was coded as underlying cause. Although the data extracted for this study included cases presenting up to Sept 22, 2021, the analyses reported here are restricted to cases and controls presenting from Dec 1, 2020, to Sept 8, 2021, ensuring follow-up for at least 14 days after presentation date to allow classification of hospitalisation and (for most cases) severity based on entry to critical care or fatal outcome. FINDINGS: During the study period, a total of 5645 severe cases of COVID-19 were recorded; these were matched to 50 096 controls. Of the severe cases, 4495 (80%) were not vaccinated, and of the controls, 36 879 (74%) were not vaccinated. Of the severe cases of COVID-19 who had been vaccinated, 389 had received an mRNA vaccine and 759 had received the ChAdOx1 vaccine. The efficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 decreased in May, 2021, coinciding with the replacement of the alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant by the delta variant in Scotland, but this decrease was reversed over the following month. In the most recent time window centred on July 29, 2021, the efficacy of two doses was 91% (95% CI 87–94) for the ChAdOx1 vaccine and 92% (88–95) for mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) vaccines. The efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 declined with time since second dose to 69% (95% CI 52–80) at 20 weeks from second dose. The efficacy of mRNA vaccines declined in the first ten weeks from second dose but more slowly thereafter to 93% (88–96) at 20 weeks from second dose. INTERPRETATION: Our results are reassuring with respect to concerns that vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta variant became predominant, or that efficacy of mRNA vaccines wanes within the first 5–6 months after second dose. However, the efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes substantially by 20 weeks from second dose. Efficacy of mRNA vaccines after 20 weeks and against newer variants remains to be established. Our findings support the case for additional protective measures for those at risk of severe disease, including, but not limited to, booster doses, at times when transmission rates are high or expected to rise.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the response to outbreaks. This study reviewed literature data and found that HCWs were at high risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially at the early stage of the epidemic, and many factors greatly affected their occupational safety.

62	10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c01626	[Image: see text] The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that started in late 2019 is responsible for hundreds of millions of cases worldwide and millions of fatalities. Though vaccines are available, the virus is mutating to form new strains among which are the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 that demonstrate increased transmissivity and infectivity. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore the role of the mutations in the interaction of the virus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with the host receptor ACE2. We find that the hydrogen bond networks are rearranged in the variants and also that new hydrogen bonds are established between the RBD and ACE2 as a result of mutations. We investigated three variants: the wild-type (WT), B.1.1.7, and B.1.351. We find that the B.1.351 variant (also known as 501Y.V2) shows larger flexibility in the RBD loop segment involving residue K484, yet the RBD–ACE2 complex shows higher stability. Mutations that allow a more flexible interface that can result in a more stable complex may be a factor contributing to the increased infectivity of the mutated variants.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351
63	10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00410	[Image: see text] With the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolutionary fate of SARS-CoV-2 becomes a matter of utmost concern. Mutation D614G in the spike (S) protein has become dominant, and recent evidence suggests it yields a more stable phenotype with higher transmission efficacy. We carry out a structural analysis that provides mechanistic clues on the enhanced infectivity. The D614G substitution creates a sticky packing defect in subunit S1, promoting its association with subunit S2 as a means to stabilize the structure of S1 within the S1/S2 complex. The results raise the therapeutic possibility of immunologically targeting the epitope involved in stabilizing the G614 phenotype as a means of reducing the infection efficacy of SARS-CoV-2. This therapeutic modality would not a-priori interfere directly with current efforts toward the immunological targeting of the RBD epitope; hence, it could be exploited as a complementary treatment.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
64	10.1038/s41467-021-21118-2	The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is steadily mutating during continuous transmission among humans. Such mutations can occur in the spike (S) protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor and is cleaved by TMPRSS2. However, whether S mutations affect SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remains unknown. Here, we show that naturally occurring S mutations can reduce or enhance cell entry via ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus exhibits substantially lower entry than that of SARS-CoV S. Among S variants, the D614G mutant shows the highest cell entry, as supported by structural and binding analyses. Nevertheless, the D614G mutation does not affect neutralization by antisera against prototypic viruses. Taken together, we conclude that the D614G mutation increases cell entry by acquiring higher affinity to ACE2 while maintaining neutralization susceptibility. Based on these findings, further worldwide surveillance is required to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility among humans.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G

The efficacy of spike encoding mRNA vaccines (CVnCoV and CV2CoV) against the ancestral strain and the VOC B.1.351 was tested in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with a formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice develop elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody and neutralization titers which are readily detectable, but significantly reduced against VOC B.1.351. The mRNA vaccines fully protect from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. SARS-CoV-2 remains undetected in swabs, lung, or brain in these groups. Despite lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to the ancestral strain BavPat1, CVnCoV and CV2CoV show complete disease protection against the novel VOC B.1.351 in our studies.	mutation_name_list: B.1.351
66	10.1038/s41467-021-25168-4	Wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is critical to tracking viral evolution during the ongoing pandemic. We develop the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detect an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage. In concert with other variants, like B.1.1.7, the rise of B.1.526 appears to have extended the duration of the second wave of COVID-19 cases in NYC in early 2021. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, supporting the public health relevance of this lineage.	mutation_name_list: B.1.526
67	10.1038/s41467-021-27325-1	Despite an unprecedented global gain in knowledge since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, almost all mechanistic knowledge related to the molecular and cellular details of viral replication, pathology and virulence has been generated using early prototypic isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Here, using atomic force microscopy and molecular dynamics, we investigated how these mutations quantitatively affected the kinetic, thermodynamic and structural properties of RBD—ACE2 complex formation. We observed for several variants of concern a significant increase in the RBD—ACE2 complex stability. While the N501Y and E484Q mutations are particularly important for the greater stability, the N501Y mutation is unlikely to significantly affect antibody neutralization. This work provides unprecedented atomistic detail on the binding of SARS-CoV-2 variants and provides insight into the impact of viral mutations on infection-induced immunity.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_E484K
68	10.1038/s41467-022-29104-y	SARS-CoV-2 remdesivir resistance mutations have been generated in vitro but have not been reported in patients receiving treatment with the antiviral agent. We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with acquired B-cell deficiency who developed an indolent, protracted course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient virologic response, but her course was complicated by recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding. Whole genome sequencing identified a mutation, E802D, in the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which was not present in pre-treatment specimens. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation conferred a ~6-fold increase in remdesivir IC(50) but resulted in a fitness cost in the absence of remdesivir. Sustained clinical and virologic response was achieved after treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab. Although the fitness cost observed in vitro may limit the risk posed by E802D, this case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_E802D
69	10.1038/s41564-021-01047-y	The major transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 is airborne. However, previous studies could not elucidate the contribution between large droplets and aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Here, we designed and validated an optimized transmission caging setup, which allows for the assessment of aerosol transmission efficiency at various distances. At a distance of 2 m, only particles of <5 µm traversed between cages. Using this setup, we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission between the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and lineage A in Syrian hamsters. Aerosol transmission of both variants was confirmed in all sentinels after 24 h of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory virus shedding and seroconversion. Productive transmission also occurred after 1 h of exposure, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, after donors were infected with a mix of both variants, the Alpha variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain. Overall, these data indicate that a lower infectious dose of the Alpha variant, compared to lineage A, could be sufficient for successful transmission. This highlights the continuous need to assess emerging variants and the development for pre-emptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
70	10.1038/s41586-021-03361-1	During the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans a D614G substitution in the spike (S) protein emerged and became the predominant circulating variant (S-614G) of the COVID-19 pandemic1. However, whether the increasing prevalence of the S-614G variant represents a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains elusive. Here, we generated isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate that the S-614G variant has (i) enhanced binding to human host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), (ii) increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a novel human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and (iii) markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data show that while the S-614G substitution results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro, it provides a real competitive advantage in vivo, particularly during the transmission bottle neck, providing an explanation for the global predominance of S-614G variant among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently circulating.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
71	10.1038/s41586-021-03412-7	SARS-CoV-2 transmission is uncontrolled in many parts of the world, compounded in some areas by higher transmission potential of the B1.1.7 variant1 now reported in 94 countries. It is unclear whether responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the prototypic strain will be impacted by mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralising antibody responses following first and second immunisations using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein. The vaccine sera exhibited a broad range of neutralising titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some convalescent patients. Decreased B.1.1.7 neutralisation was also observed with monoclonal antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10), the RBM (5 out of 31), but not in RBD neutralising mAbs binding outside the RBM. Introduction of the E484K mutation in a B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emergent Variant of Concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more substantial loss of neutralising activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and mAbs (19 out of 31) over that conferred by the B.1.1.7 mutations alone. E484K emergence on a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the vaccine BNT162b.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, SPIKE_E484K
72	10.1038/s41586-021-04245-0	Beginning in the summer of 2020, a variant of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, emerged in the United Kingdom. This B.1.1.7 variant, also known as Alpha, increased rapidly in prevalence, attributed to an increase in infection and/or transmission efficiency1. The Alpha variant has 19 nonsynonymous mutations across its viral genome, including 8 substitutions or deletions in the spike protein, which interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we show that, of the 8 individual spike protein substitutions, only N501Y exhibited consistent fitness gains for replication in the upper airway in the hamster model as well as primary human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 Alpha spike mutations, suggesting it is a major determinant of increased transmission of this variant. Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in Brazil, South Africa, and elsewhere2,3, our results indicate that N501Y substitution is a major adaptive spike mutation of major concern.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, SPIKE_N501Y
73	10.1038/s41586-022-04442-5	SARS-CoV-2 Omicron emerged in November 2021 and is rapidly spreading among the human population1. While recent reports reveal that the Omicron variant robustly escapes from vaccine and therapeutic neutralization antibodies2-10, the pathogenicity of the virus remains unknown. Here we show that the replication of the Omicron variant is dramatically attenuated in Calu3 and Caco2 cells. Further mechanistic investigations reveal that the Omicron variant is inefficient in transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) usage in comparison to that of WT and previous variants, which may explain its reduced replication in Calu3 and Caco2 cells. Omicron replication is markedly attenuated in both the upper and lower respiratory tract of infected K18-hACE2 mice in comparison to that of WT and Delta variant, which results in its dramatically ameliorated lung pathology. When compared with SARS-CoV-2 WT, Alpha, Beta, and Delta variant, infection by the Omicron variant causes the least body weight loss and mortality rate. Overall, our study demonstrates that the Omicron variant is attenuated in virus replication and pathogenicity in mice in comparison with WT and previous variants.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON

Here, we show that pseudovirus expressing 501Y.V2 spike protein completely escapes three classes of therapeutically relevant antibodies. This pseudovirus also exhibits substantial to complete escape from neutralization, but not binding, by convalescent plasma. These data highlight the prospect of reinfection with antigenically distinct variants and foreshadows reduced efficacy of spike-based vaccines.	mutation_name_list: B.1.351
75	10.1038/s41591-021-01318-5	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, and have since spread to many countries. These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351. In contrast, sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals similarly bound the three spike proteins in a flow cytometry-based serological assay. Neutralizing antibodies were rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees. Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels. Our results indicate that B1.351, but not B.1.1.7, may increase the risk of infection in immunized individuals.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351
76	10.1038/s41591-021-01678-y	The emergence of the highly transmissible B.1.1.529 Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is concerning for antibody countermeasure efficacy because of the number of mutations in the spike protein. In this study, we tested a panel of anti-receptor-binding domain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) corresponding to those in clinical use by Vir Biotechnology (S309, the parent mAb of VIR-7831 (sotrovimab)), AstraZeneca (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, the parent mAbs of AZD8895 and AZD1061), Regeneron (REGN10933 and REGN10987), Eli Lilly (LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016) and Celltrion (CT-P59) for their ability to neutralize an infectious B.1.1.529 Omicron isolate. Several mAbs (LY-CoV555, LY-CoV016, REGN10933, REGN10987 and CT-P59) completely lost neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529 virus in both Vero-TMPRSS2 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, whereas others were reduced (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 combination, ~12-fold decrease) or minimally affected (S309). Our results suggest that several, but not all, of the antibodies in clinical use might lose efficacy against the B.1.1.529 Omicron variant.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.529
77	10.1038/s41594-021-00652-z	The B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2 first detected in the UK harbors amino-acid substitutions and deletions in the spike protein that potentially enhance host angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding and viral immune evasion. Here we report cryo-EM structures of the spike protein of B.1.1.7 in the apo and ACE2-bound forms. The apo form showed one or two receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in the open conformation, without populating the fully closed state. All three RBDs were engaged in ACE2 binding. The B.1.1.7-specific A570D mutation introduces a molecular switch that could modulate the opening and closing of the RBD. The N501Y mutation introduces a π-π interaction that enhances RBD binding to ACE2 and abolishes binding of a potent neutralizing antibody (nAb). Cryo-EM also revealed how a cocktail of two nAbs simultaneously bind to all three RBDs, and demonstrated the potency of the nAb cocktail to neutralize different SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus strains, including B.1.1.7.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_A570D, SPIKE_N501Y
78	10.1038/s41598-021-01650-3	The mutation of SARS-CoV-2 influences viral function as residue replacements affect both physiochemical properties and folding conformations. Although a large amount of data on SARS-CoV-2 is available, the investigation of how viral functions change in response to mutations is hampered by a lack of effective structural analysis. Here, we exploit the advances of protein structure fingerprint technology to study the folding conformational changes induced by mutations. With integration of both protein sequences and folding conformations, the structures are aligned for SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, including Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) and Delta variant (lineage B.1.617.2). The results showed that the virus evolution with change in mutational positions and physicochemical properties increased the affinity between spike protein and ACE2, which plays a critical role in coronavirus entry into human cells. Additionally, these structural variations impact vaccine effectiveness and drug function over the course of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The analysis of structural variations revealed how the coronavirus has gradually evolved in both structure and function and how the SARS-CoV-2 variants have contributed to more severe acute disease worldwide.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.617.2
79	10.1038/s41598-021-83761-5	Since the worldwide outbreak of the infectious disease COVID-19, several studies have been published to understand the structural mechanism of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. During the infection process, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a crucial role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process by interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. However, new variants of these spike proteins emerge as the virus passes through the disease reservoir. This poses a major challenge for designing a potent antigen for an effective immune response against the spike protein. Through a normal mode analysis (NMA) we identified the highly flexible region in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, starting from residue 475 up to residue 485. Structurally, the position S477 shows the highest flexibility among them. At the same time, S477 is hitherto the most frequently exchanged amino acid residue in the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Therefore, using MD simulations, we have investigated the role of S477 and its two frequent mutations (S477G and S477N) at the RBD during the binding to hACE2. We found that the amino acid exchanges S477G and S477N strengthen the binding of the SARS-COV-2 spike with the hACE2 receptor.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_S477G, SPIKE_S477N
80	10.1038/s41598-021-84053-8	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerged coronavirus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); it become a pandemic since March 2020. To date, there have been described three lineages of SARS-CoV-2 circulating worldwide, two of them are found among Mexican population, within these, we observed three mutations of spike (S) protein located at amino acids H49Y, D614G, and T573I. To understand if these mutations could affect the structural behavior of S protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the binding with S protein inhibitors (cepharanthine, nelfinavir, and hydroxychloroquine), molecular dynamic simulations and molecular docking were employed. It was found that these punctual mutations affect considerably the structural behavior of the S protein compared to wild type, which also affect the binding of its inhibitors into their respective binding site. Thus, further experimental studies are needed to explore if these affectations have an impact on drug-S protein binding and its possible clinical effect.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_H49Y, SPIKE_D614G, SPIKE_T573I
81	10.1038/s41598-021-94055-1	While there has been significant progress in the development of rapid COVID-19 diagnostics, as the pandemic unfolds, new challenges have emerged, including whether these technologies can reliably detect the more infectious variants of concern and be viably deployed in non-clinical settings as “self-tests”. Multidisciplinary evaluation of the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card (BinaxNOW, a widely used rapid antigen test, included limit of detection, variant detection, test performance across different age-groups, and usability with self/caregiver-administration. While BinaxNOW detected the highly infectious variants, B.1.1.7 (Alpha) first identified in the UK, B.1.351 (Beta) first identified in South Africa, P.1 (Gamma) first identified in Brazil, B.1.617.2 (Delta) first identified in India and B.1.2, a non-VOC, test sensitivity decreased with decreasing viral loads. Moreover, BinaxNOW sensitivity trended lower when devices were performed by patients/caregivers themselves compared to trained clinical staff, despite universally high usability assessments following self/caregiver-administration among different age groups. Overall, these data indicate that while BinaxNOW accurately detects the new viral variants, as rapid COVID-19 tests enter the home, their already lower sensitivities compared to RT-PCR may decrease even more due to user error.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, P.1, B.1.2
82	10.1080/07391102.2020.1823885	COVID-19 an outbreak of a novel corona virus originating from Wuhan, China in December 2019 has now spread across the entire world and has been declared a pandemic by WHO. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor protein that interacts with the spike glycoprotein of the host to facilitate the entry of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) hence causing the disease (COVID-19). Our experimental design is based on bioinformatics approach that combines sequence, structure and consensus based tools to label a protein coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as damaging/deleterious or neutral. The interaction of wildtype ACE2-spike glycoprotein and their variants were analyzed using docking studies. The mutations W461R, G405E and F588S in ACE2 receptor protein and population specific mutations P391S, C12S and G1223A in the spike glycoprotein were predicted as highly destabilizing to the structure of the bound complex. So far, no extensive in silico study has been reported that identifies the effect of SNPs on Spike glycoprotein-ACE2 interaction exploring both sequence and structural features. To this end, this study conducted an in-depth analysis that facilitates in identifying the mutations that blocks the interaction of two proteins that can result in stopping the virus from entering the host cell.

83	10.1080/07391102.2021.1944319	One major obstacle in designing a successful therapeutic regimen to combat COVID-19 pandemic is the frequent occurrence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 resulting in patient to patient variations. Out of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 namely, spike, envelope, nucleocapsid and membrane, envelope protein governs the virus pathogenicity and induction of acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. These effects are facilitated by the viroporin (ion-channel) like activities of the envelope protein. Our current work reports metagenomic analysis of envelope protein at the amino acid sequence level through mining all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID and coronapp servers. We found majority of mutations in envelope protein were localized at or near PDZ binding motif. Our analysis also demonstrates that the acquired mutations might have important implications on its structure and ion-channel activity. A statistical correlation between specific mutations (e.g. F4F, R69I, P71L, L73F) with patient mortalities were also observed, based on the patient data available for 18,691 SARS-CoV-2-genomes in the GISAID database till 30 April 2021. Albeit, whether these mutations exist as the cause or the effect of co-infections and/or co-morbid disorders within COVID-19 patients is still unclear. Moreover, most of the current vaccine and therapeutic interventions are revolving around spike protein. However, emphasizing on envelope protein's (1) conserved epitopes, (2) pathogenicity attenuating mutations, and (3) mutations present in the deceased patients, as reported in our present study, new directions to the ongoing efforts of therapeutic developments against COVID-19 can be achieved by targeting envelope viroporin.	mutation_name_list: E_F4F, E_R69I, E_P71L, E_L73F

In this study, we analyzed the most predominant mutations in the S protein of Brazilian isolates and predicted the effect of these amino acid alterations to protein conformation. A total of 25,924 sequences were obtained from GISAID for five regions of Brazilian territory (Midwest, North, Northeast, South, and Southeast), according to exclusion criteria. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates belongs to the G clade and showed a large occurrence of D614G, N501Y and L18F substitutions. Prediction effects of these amino acid substitutions on the structure dynamics of the spike protein indicated a positive ΔΔG values and negative ΔΔSVib in most cases which is associated to structural stabilization and flexibility reduction of the S protein. Mutations E484K, N501Y and K417N belong to several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, and showed high incidence among Brazilian isolates. These mutations have been described to increase RBD affinity to ACE-2 host and abolishment of RBD affinity to potent neutralizing ant-RBD. The increase in rates of infection and reinfection requires continuous genomic surveillance studies in order to characterize emerging mutations and monitor vaccine efficacy, and thus consideration structural data and dynamics in the observed phenotypes.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

85	10.1080/07391102.2022.2032354	The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus-2 (SARS CoV-2) infection has resulted in the current global pandemic. The binding of SARS CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor causes the host infection. The spike protein has undergone several mutations with reference to the initial strain isolated during December 2019 from Wuhan, China. A number of these mutant strains have been reported as variants of concern and as variants being monitored. Some of these mutants are known to be responsible for increased transmissibility of the virus. The reason for the increased transmissibility caused by the point mutations can be understood by studying the structural implications and inter-molecular interactions in the binding of viral spike protein RBD and human ACE-2. Here, we use the crystal structure of the RBD in complex with ACE-2 available in the public domain and analyse the 250 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of wild-type and mutants; K417N, K417T, N440K, N501Y, L452R, T478K, E484K and S494P. The ionic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions, amino acid residue flexibility, binding energies and structural variations are characterized. The MD simulations provide clues to the molecular mechanisms of ACE-2 receptor binding in wild-type and mutant complexes.

86	10.1080/07391102.2022.2051746	Mutations drive viral evolution and genome variability that causes viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. SARS-CoV-2 has considerably higher mutation rate. SARS-CoV-2 possesses a RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which helps to replicate its genome. The mutation P323L in RdRp is associated with the loss of a particular epitope (321-327) from this protein. We consider the effects of mutations in some of the epitope region including the naturally occurring mutation P323L on the structure of the epitope and their interface with paratope using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. We observe that the mutations cause conformational changes in the epitope region by opening up the region associated with increase in the radius of gyration and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, making the region less accessible. Moreover, we study the conformational stability of the epitope region and epitope:paratope interface under the mutation from the fluctuations in the dihedral angles. We observe that the mutation renders the epitope and the epitope:paratope interface unstable compared to the corresponding wild type ones. Thus, the mutations may help in escaping antibody mediated immunity of the hostCommunicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_P323L
87	10.1093/cid/ciab721	BACKGROUND: he impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) on disease severity is unclear. In this retrospective study, we compared outcomes of patients infected with B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 with those with wild-type strains from early 2020. METHODS: National surveillance data from 1-January-2021 to 22-May-2021 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, and outcomes in relation to VOC were explored. Detailed patient level data from all patients with VOC infection admitted to our center between 20-December-2020 and 12-May-2021 were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were compared with a cohort of 846 patients admitted from January-April 2020. RESULTS: 829 patients in Singapore in the study period were infected with these 3 VOCs. After adjusting for age and sex, B.1.617.2 was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or death (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.90, [95% CI 1.43-30.78]). 157 of these patients were admitted to our center. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and vaccination, aOR for pneumonia with B.1.617.2 was 1.88 [95% CI 0.95-3.76]) compared with wild-type. These differences were not seen with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Vaccination status was associated with decreased severity. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and longer duration of Ct value ≤30 (median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2, 13 days for wild-type). CONCLUSIONS: There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility. These findings provide an impetus for the rapid implementation of vaccination programs.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2

89	10.1093/pcmedi/pbab024	The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has evolved as the dominant strain of the current pandemic. Studies have shown that this variant has increased infectivity/viral load, and reduced neutralization by the host antibodies from convalescent patients/vaccinees. Clinically, Delta variant infection have been observed/documented in convalescent patients/vaccinees, although with less incidence of severe diseases, but can serve as reservoir to spread the infection to the unvaccinated. The current understanding (as of August 18, 2021) on the virologic aspect (including the amino acid substitutions), clinical implications, and the public health implications will be discussed in this review, and recommendations to health authorities will be provided.	mutation_name_list: DELTA
90	10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac049	Worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts track emerging mutations in its spike protein, as well as characteristic mutations in other viral proteins. Besides their epidemiological importance, the observed SARS-CoV-2 sequences present an ensemble of viable protein variants, and thereby a source of information on viral protein structure and function. Charting the mutational landscape of the nucleocapsid (N) protein that facilitates viral assembly, we observe variability exceeding that of the spike protein, with more than 86% of residues that can be substituted, on average by three to four different amino acids. However, mutations exhibit an uneven distribution that tracks known structural features but also reveals highly protected stretches of unknown function. One of these conserved regions is in the central disordered linker proximal to the N-G215C mutation that has become dominant in the Delta variant, outcompeting G215 variants without further spike or N-protein substitutions. Structural models suggest that the G215C mutation stabilizes conserved transient helices in the disordered linker serving as protein-protein interaction interfaces. Comparing Delta variant N-protein to its ancestral version in biophysical experiments, we find a significantly more compact and less disordered structure. N-G215C exhibits substantially stronger self-association, shifting the unliganded protein from a dimeric to a tetrameric oligomeric state, which leads to enhanced coassembly with nucleic acids. This suggests that the sequence variability of N-protein is mirrored by high plasticity of N-protein biophysical properties, which we hypothesize can be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to achieve greater efficiency of viral assembly, and thereby enhanced infectivity.	mutation_name_list: DELTA, N_G215C
91	10.1101/2020.03.27.012013	The effect of the rapid accumulation of non-synonymous mutations on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known. To predict the impact of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions identified in ORF3a on the formation of B-cell epitopes and their role in evading the immune response, nucleotide and protein sequences of 537 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions. Mutations were correlated with changes in epitope formation. A total of 19 different non-synonymous amino acids substitutions were detected in ORF3a among 537 SARS-CoV-2 strains. G251V was the most common and identified in 9.9% (n=53) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a B-cell like epitope in ORF3a. Polyproline regions were detected in two strains (EPI_ISL_410486, France and EPI_ISL_407079, Finland) and affected epitopes formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations and detected polyproline regions in ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 could be driving the evasion of the host immune response thus favoring viral spread. Rapid mutations accumulating in ORF3a should be closely monitored throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Importance At the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic and after three months of the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the disease-causing pathogen, nucleic acid changes due to host-pathogen interactions are insightful into the evolution of this virus. In this paper, we have identified a set of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a and predicted their impact on B-cell like epitope formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a could be driving protein changes that mediate immune evasion and favoring viral spread.	mutation_name_list: ORF3A_G251V
92	10.1101/2020.06.14.151357	A novel isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the D614G variant and show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type. We demonstrate increased infection using both Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and intact SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction. This result has important implications for the efficacy of Spike-based vaccines currently under development in protecting against this recent and highly-prevalent SARS-CoV-2 isolate.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
93	10.1101/2020.07.04.187757	Virus genome sequence variants that appear over the course of an outbreak can be exploited to map the trajectory of the virus from one susceptible host to another. While such variants are usually of no functional significance, in some cases they may allow the virus to transmit faster, change disease severity, or confer resistance to antiviral therapies. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of COVID-19, the virus has spread around the globe, and thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced. The rate of sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates is modest for an RNA virus but the enormous number of human-to-human transmission events has provided abundant opportunity for selection of sequence variants. Among these, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant, D614G, was not present in the presumptive common ancestor of this zoonotic virus but was first detected in late January in Germany and China. The D614G variant steadily increased in frequency and now constitutes >97% of isolates world-wide, raising the question whether D614G confers a replication advantage to SARS-CoV-2. Structural models predict that D614G would disrupt contacts between the S1 and S2 domains of the Spike protein and cause significant shifts in conformation. Using single-cycle vectors we showed that D614G is three to nine-fold more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung and colon cell lines, as well as on other human cell lines rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2, or by ACE2 orthologues from pangolin, pig, dog, or cat. Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein retain full neutralization potency. These results suggest that D614G was selected for increased human-to-human transmission, that it contributed to the rapidity of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world, and that it does not confer resistance to antiviral therapies targeting the receptor binding domain.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
94	10.1101/2020.07.22.20159905	The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the COVID-19 pandemic that appears to confer on the virus greater infectivity and now globally is the dominant form of the virus. Certain of the current vaccines entering phase 3 trials are based on the early D614 form of Spike with the goal of eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies. To determine whether D614G mediates neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 Spike on their surface. In all cases, G614 Spike pseudovirions were moderately more susceptible to neutralization, indicating this is not an escape mutation that would impede current vaccines. Rather, the gain in infectivity provided by D614G came at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
95	10.1101/2020.08.07.242263	Understanding the mutational and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for treating COVID-19 and the development of a vaccine. Here, we analyzed publicly available 15,818 assembled SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, along with 2,350 raw sequence datasets sampled worldwide. We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection. Both recurrent mutations and human-to-human transmission are mechanisms that generate fitness advantageous mutations. Furthermore, the frequency of three mutations (S protein, F400L; ORF3a protein, T164I; and ORF1a protein, Q6383H) has gradual increased over time on lineages, which provides new clues for the early detection of fitness advantageous mutations. Our study provides theoretical support for vaccine development and the optimization of treatment for COVID-19. We call researchers to submit raw sequence data to public databases.	mutation_name_list: ORF3A_T164I, SPIKE_F400L, ORF1A_Q6383H
96	10.1101/2020.09.01.278689	A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an “up” conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
97	10.1101/2020.11.21.392407	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been undergoing various mutations. The analysis of the structural and energetic effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will be beneficial for epidemic surveillance, diagnosis, and optimization of neutralizing agents. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, a key mutation N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region created a new salt bridge which resulted in greater electrostatic complementarity. Furthermore, the N439K-mutated RBD bound hACE2 with a higher affinity than wild-type, which may lead to more infectious. In addition, the N439K-mutated RBD was markedly resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody REGN10987, which may lead to the failure of neutralization. These findings would offer guidance on the development of neutralizing antibodies and the prevention of COVID-19.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N439K
98	10.1101/2020.12.19.423600	Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in ≥0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in ≥0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_P323L
99	10.1101/2021.01.04.425316	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an ongoing global pandemic for over a year. Recently, an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.7) with an unusually large number of mutations had become highly contagious and wide-spreading in United Kingdom. From genome analysis, the N501Y mutation within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein might have enhanced the viral protein’s binding with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The latter is the prelude for the virus’ entry into host cells. So far, the molecular mechanism of this enhanced binding is still elusive, which prevents us from assessing its effects on existing therapeutic antibodies. Using all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that Y501 in mutated RBD can be well coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, increasing the overall binding affinity between RBD and hACE2 by about 0.81 kcal/mol. We further explored how the N501Y mutation might affect the binding between a neutralizing antibody (CB6) and RBD. We expect that our work can help researchers design proper measures responding to this urgent virus mutation, such as adding a modified/new neutralizing antibody specifically targeting at this variant in the therapeutic antibody cocktail.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y, B.1.1.7
100	10.1101/2021.01.18.426984	Recently, a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage called B.1.1.7 has emerged in the United Kingdom that was reported to spread more efficiently than other strains. This variant has an unusually large number of mutations with 10 amino acid changes in the spike protein, raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 16 participants in a previously reported trial with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had equivalent neutralizing titers to both variants. These data, together with the combined immunity involving humoral and cellular effectors induced by this vaccine, make it unlikely that the B.1.1.7 lineage will escape BNT162b2-mediated protection.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
101	10.1101/2021.01.25.427846	SARS-CoV-2 mutations can impact infectivity, viral load, and overall morbidity/mortality during infection. In this analysis, we look at the mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, a structure that is antigenic and allows for viral binding to the host. We analyze 104193 GISAID sequences acquired on October 15th, 2020 with a majority of sequences (96%) containing point mutations. We report high frequency mutations with improved binding affinity to ACE2 including S477N, N439K, V367F, and N501Y and address the potential impact of RBD mutations on antibody binding. The high frequency S477N mutation is present in 6.7% of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences, co-occurs with D614G, and is currently present in 14 countries. To address RBD-antibody interactions we take a subset of human derived antibodies and define their interacting residues using PDBsum. Our analysis shows that adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 enlists broad coverage of the RBD suggesting that antibody mediated immunity should be sufficient to resolve infection in the presence of RBD point mutations that conserve structure.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_S477N, SPIKE_N439K, SPIKE_V367F, SPIKE_N501Y
102	10.1101/2021.01.27.426895	The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected millions of people since its beginning in 2019. The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020, the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October, 2020, more than 40% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P1, P2 and B.1.1.33) in four Brazilian regions. We also evaluated the presence of E484K associated mutations and identified selective pressures acting on the spike protein, leading us to some insights about adaptive and purifying selection driving the virus evolution.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_E484K
103	10.1101/2021.01.27.428516	The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein mediates virus entry and is a major target for neutralizing antibodies. All current vaccines are based on the ancestral Spike with the goal of generating a protective neutralizing antibody response. Several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple Spike mutations have emerged, and their rapid spread and potential for immune escape have raised concerns. One of these variants, first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.1.7 (also called VUI202012/01), contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy, vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we employed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus assay to show that variant B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization, albeit at moderately reduced levels (~2-fold), by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of two different vaccines based on ancestral Spike: mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax). Some monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike were less effective against the variant while others were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that B.1.1.7 is not a neutralization escape variant that would be a major concern for current vaccines, or for an increased risk of reinfection.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
104	10.1101/2021.02.03.429495	SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading rapidly since 2019 and has produced large-scale mutations in the genomes. Differences in gene sequences may lead to changes in protein structure and traits, which would have a great impact on the epidemiological characteristics. In this study, we selected the key mutations of SARS-CoV-2, including D614G and A222V of S protein and Q57H of ORF3a protein, to conduct molecular dynamics simulation and analysis on the structures of the mutant proteins. The results suggested that D614G improved the stability of S protein, while A222V enhanced the ability of protein to react with the outside environment. Q57H enhanced the structural flexibility of ORF3a protein. Our findings could complete the mechanistic link between genotype--phenotype--epidemiological characteristics in the study of SARS-CoV-2. We also found no significant changes in the antigenicity of S protein, ORF3a protein and their mutants, which provides reference for vaccine development and application.	mutation_name_list: ORF3A_Q57H, SPIKE_D614G, SPIKE_A222V
105	10.1101/2021.02.06.21251159	As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
106	10.1101/2021.02.14.431043	Wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is critical to tracking viral evolution during the ongoing pandemic. Variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil have spread to multiple countries. We developed the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detected an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020 when it represented <1% of sequenced coronavirus genomes that were collected in New York City (NYC). By February 2021, genomes from this lineage accounted for ~32% of 3288 sequenced genomes from NYC specimens. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage in NYC, notably the sub-clade defined by the spike mutation E484K, which has outpaced the growth of other variants in NYC. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, indicating the public health importance of this lineage.	mutation_name_list: B.1.526
107	10.1101/2021.02.17.431683	Monoclonal antibodies and antibody cocktails are a promising therapeutic and prophylaxis for COVID-19. However, ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 can render monoclonal antibodies ineffective. Here we completely map all mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) that escape binding by a leading monoclonal antibody, LY-CoV555, and its cocktail combination with LY-CoV016. Individual mutations that escape binding by each antibody are combined in the circulating B.1.351 and P.1 SARS-CoV-2 lineages (E484K escapes LY-CoV555, K417N/T escape LY-CoV016). Additionally, the L452R mutation in the B.1.429 lineage escapes LY-CoV555. Furthermore, we identify single amino acid changes that escape the combined LY-CoV555+LY-CoV016 cocktail. We suggest that future efforts should diversify the epitopes targeted by antibodies and antibody cocktails to make them more resilient to antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_E484K, SPIKE_K417N, SPIKE_K417T, SPIKE_L452R
108	10.1101/2021.02.22.432359	SARS-CoV2 being highly infectious has been particularly effective in causing widespread infection globally and more variants of SARS-CoV2 are constantly being reported with increased genomic surveillance. In particular, the focus is on mutations of Spike protein, which binds human ACE2 protein enabling SARS-CoV2 entry and infection. Here we present a rapid experimental method leveraging the speed and flexibility of Mircoscale Thermopheresis (MST) to characterize the interaction between Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and human ACE2 protein. The B.1.351 variant harboring three mutations, (E484K, N501Y, and K417N) binds the ACE2 at nearly five-fold greater affinity than the original SARS-COV-2 RBD. We also find that the B.1.1.7 variant, binds two-fold more tightly to ACE2 than the SARS-COV-2 RBD.	mutation_name_list: B.1.351, B.1.1.7
109	10.1101/2021.03.09.21253242	Previous work has shown that environment affects SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but it is unclear whether emerging strains show similar responses. Here we show that lineage B.1.1.7 spread with greater transmission in colder and more densely populated parts of England. We also find evidence of B.1.1.7's transmission advantage at warmer temperatures versus other strains, implying that spring conditions may facilitate B.1.1.7's invasion in Europe and across the Northern hemisphere, undermining the effectiveness of public health interventions.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
110	10.1101/2021.03.11.435037	New SARS-CoV-2 variants that have accumulated multiple mutations in the spike (S) glycoprotein enable increased transmission and resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Here, we study the antigenic and structural impacts of the S protein mutations from four variants, one that was involved in transmission between minks and humans, and three that rapidly spread in human populations and originated in the United Kingdom, Brazil or South Africa. All variants either retained or improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. The B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.1.28 (Brazil) spike variants showed reduced binding to neutralizing NTD and RBD antibodies, respectively, while the B.1.351 (SA) variant showed reduced binding to both NTD- and RBD-directed antibodies. Cryo-EM structural analyses revealed allosteric effects of the mutations on spike conformations and revealed mechanistic differences that either drive inter-species transmission or promotes viral escape from dominant neutralizing epitopes. Highlights Cryo-EM structures reveal changes in SARS-CoV-2 S protein during inter-species transmission or immune evasion. Adaptation to mink resulted in increased ACE2 binding and spike destabilization. B.1.1.7 S mutations reveal an intricate balance of stabilizing and destabilizing effects that impact receptor and antibody binding. E484K mutation in B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 S proteins drives immune evasion by altering RBD conformation. S protein uses different mechanisms to converge upon similar solutions for altering RBD up/down positioning.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.1.28, B.1.351, SPIKE_E484K
111	10.1101/2021.03.25.21253908	Routine detection, surveillance and reporting of SARS-CoV-2 novel variants is important, as these threaten to hinder vaccination efforts. Herein we report a local novel strain that includes a non-synonymous mutation in the spike (S) protein - P681H and additional synonymous mutations. The P681H Israeli strain has not been associated with higher infection rates and was neutralized by sera from vaccinated individuals in comparable levels to the B.1.1.7 strain and a non-P681H strain from Israel.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_P681H
112	10.1101/2021.03.28.437426	The D614G mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alters the fitness of the virus, making it the dominant form in the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we demonstrated by cryo-electron microscopy that the D614G mutation does not significantly perturb the structure of the spike protein, but multiple receptor binding domains are in an upward conformation poised for host receptor binding. The impact of the mutation lies in its ability to eliminate the unusual cold-induced unfolding characteristics, and to significantly increase the thermal stability under physiological pH. Our findings shed light on how the D614G mutation enhances the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through a stabilizing mutation, and suggest an approach for better design of spike-protein based conjugates for vaccine development.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
113	10.1101/2021.05.03.441080	A new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has started as several SARS-CoV-2 variants are rapidly emerging globally, raising concerns for increased transmissibility. As animal models and traditional in vitro systems may fail to model key aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, representative in vitro systems to assess variants phenotypically are urgently needed. We found that the British variant (clade B.1.1.7), compared to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 clade B virus, produced higher levels of infectious virus late in infection and had a higher replicative fitness in human airway, alveolar and intestinal organoid models. Our findings unveil human organoids as powerful tools to phenotype viral variants and suggest extended shedding as a correlate of fitness for SARS-CoV-2. One-Sentence Summary British SARS-CoV-2 variant (clade B.1.1.7) infects organoids for extended time and has a higher fitness in vitro.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
114	10.1101/2021.05.07.21256341	The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness is not known. Using data from a prospective cohort of index cases and high-risk contact, we reconstructed by modelling the viral load at the time of contact and the probability of infection. The effect of viral load was particularly large in household contacts, with a transmission probability that increased to as much as 37% when the viral load was greater than 10 log 10 copies per mL. The transmission probability peaked at symptom onset in most individuals, with a median probability of transmission of 15%, that hindered large individual variations (IQR: [8, 37]). The model also projects the effects of variants on disease transmission. Based on the current knowledge that viral load is increased by 2 to 4-fold on average, we estimate that infection with B1.1.7 virus could lead to an increase in the probability of transmission by 8 to 17%.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
115	10.1101/2021.06.04.21258333	In early 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 became dominant across large parts of the world. In Denmark, comprehensive and real-time test, contact-tracing, and sequencing efforts were applied to sustain epidemic control. Here, we use these data to investigate the transmissibility, introduction, and onward transmission of B.1.1.7 in Denmark. In a period with stable restrictions, we estimated an increased B.1.1.7 transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%,60%]) relative to other lineages. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that 37% of B.1.1.7 cases were related to the initial introduction in November 2020. Continuous introductions contributed substantially to case numbers, highlighting the benefit of balanced travel restrictions and self-isolation procedures coupled with comprehensive surveillance efforts, to sustain epidemic control in the face of emerging variants.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
116	10.1101/2021.06.10.21258468	Several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) are spreading rapidly in different regions of the world. The underlying mechanisms behind their transmission advantage remain unclear. We measured viral load in 950 individuals and found that infections with variant Alpha exhibit a higher viral load and longer viral shedding compared to non-VOC. We then used a transmission model to analyze the spread of variant Alpha in Geneva, Switzerland, and variant Beta in South Africa. We estimated that Alpha is either associated with a 37% (95% compatibility interval, CI: 25-63%) increase in transmissibility or a 51% (95% CI: 32-80%) increase of the infectious duration, or a combination of the two mechanisms. Assuming 50% immune evasion for Beta, we estimated a 23% (95% CI: 10-37%) increase in transmissibility or a 38% (95% CI: 15-78%) increase of the infectious duration for this variant. Beta is expected to outgrow Alpha in regions where the level of naturally acquired immunity from previously circulating variants exceeds 20% to 40%. Close monitoring of Alpha and Beta in regions with different levels of immunity will help to anticipate the global spread of these and future variants.	mutation_name_list: ALPHA, BETA
117	10.1101/2021.06.16.21259017	Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean, has had a unique experience of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In March 2020, Mauritius endured a small first wave and quickly implemented control measures which allowed elimination of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. When borders to the island reopened, it was accompanied by mandatory quarantine and testing of incoming passengers to avoid reintroduction of the virus into the community. As variants of concern (VOCs) emerged elsewhere in the world, Mauritius began using genomic surveillance to keep track of quarantined cases of these variants. In March 2021, another local outbreak occurred, and sequencing was used to investigate this new wave of local infections. Here, we analyze 154 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Mauritius, which represent 12% of all the infections seem in Mauritius, these were both from specimens of incoming passengers before March 2021 and those of cases during the second wave. Our findings indicate that despite the presence of known VOCs Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) among quarantined passengers, the second wave of local SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mauritius was caused by a single introduction and dominant circulation of the B.1.1.318 virus. The B.1.1.318 variant is characterized by fourteen non-synonymous mutations in the S-gene, with five encoded amino acid substitutions (T95I, E484K, D614G, P681H, D796H) and one deletion (Y144del) in the Spike glycoprotein. This variant seems to be increasing in prevalence and it is now present in 34 countries. This study highlights that despite having stopped the introduction of more transmissible VOCs by travel quarantines, a single undetected introduction of a B.1.1.318 lineage virus was enough to initiate a large local outbreak in Mauritius and demonstrated the need for continuous genomic surveillance to fully inform public health decisions.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.318
118	10.1101/2021.07.26.453518	Airborne transmission, a term combining both large droplet and aerosol transmission, is thought to be the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
119	10.1101/2021.08.05.455082	Newly evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants are driving ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 around the world. Efforts to determine why these viral variants have improved fitness are limited to mutations in the viral spike (S) protein and viral entry steps using non-SARS-CoV-2 viral particles engineered to display S. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and rapid dissection of multiple steps in the viral life cycle. Identification of an RNA packaging sequence was critical for engineered transcripts to assemble together with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) into non-replicative SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) that deliver these transcripts to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells. Using SC2-VLPs, we tested the effect of 30 individual mutations within the S and N proteins on particle assembly and entry. While S mutations unexpectedly did not affect these steps, SC2-VLPs bearing any one of four N mutations found universally in more-transmissible viral variants (P199L, S202R, R203M and R203K) showed increased particle production and up to 10-fold more reporter transcript expression in receiver cells. Our study provides a platform for rapid testing of viral variants outside a biosafety level 3 setting and identifies viral N mutations and viral particle assembly as mechanisms to explain the increased spread of current viral variants, including Delta (N:R203M). One-Sentence Summary R203M substitution within SARS-CoV-2 N, found in delta variant, improves RNA packaging into virus-like particles by 10-fold.	mutation_name_list: N_R203M, N_P199L, N_S202R, N_R203K, DELTA
120	10.1101/2021.08.12.21261991	Background: The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has become predominant globally. We evaluated the transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the Delta variant in an outbreak in southern China. Methods: Data on confirmed cases and their close contacts were retrospectively collected from the outbreak that occurred in Guangdong, China in May-June 2021. Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated and compared between the Delta variant and the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. Results: We identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. The mean estimates of the latent period and the incubation period were 4.0 days and 5.8 days, respectively. A relatively higher viral load was observed in Delta cases than in wild-type infections. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of Delta cases was 1.4%, and 73.9% (95% confidence interval: 67.2%, 81.3%) of the transmissions occurred before onset. Index cases without vaccination (OR: 2.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 8.45) or with one dose of vaccination (OR: 6.02, 95% confidence interval: 2.45, 18.16) were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received 2 doses of vaccination. Discussion: Patients infected with the Delta variant had more rapid symptom onset. The shorter and time-varying serial interval should be accounted in estimation of reproductive numbers. The higher viral load and higher risk of pre-symptomatic transmission indicated the challenges in control of infections with the Delta variant.	mutation_name_list: DELTA
121	10.1101/2021.08.12.456173	SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has rapidly replaced the Alpha variant around the world. The mechanism that drives this global replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.	mutation_name_list: DELTA, SPIKE_P681R, SPIKE_P681H
122	10.1101/2021.08.14.21262020	Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2), initially identified in India, has become predominant in several countries, including Portugal. Few studies have compared the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against Delta versus Alpha variant of concern (VOC) and estimated variant-specific viral loads in vaccine infection breakthroughs cases. In the context of Delta dominance, this information is critical to inform decision-makers regarding the planning of restrictions and vaccination roll-out. Methods: We developed a case-case study to compare mRNA vaccines' effectiveness against Delta (B.1.617.2) versus Alpha (B.1.1.7) variants. We used RT-PCR positive cases notified to the National Surveillance System between 17th of May and 4th of July 2021 (week 20 to 26) and information about demographics and vaccination status through the electronic vaccination register. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or spike (S) gene target failure (SGTF) data were used to classify SARS-CoV-2 variants. The odds of vaccinated individuals to become infected (odds of vaccine infection breakthrough) in Delta cases compared to Alpha SARS-CoV-2 cases was estimated by conditional logistic regression adjusted for age group, sex, and matched by the week of diagnosis. As a surrogate of viral load, mean RT-PCR Ct values were stratified and compared between vaccine status and VOC. Results: Of the 2 097 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases included in the analysis, 966 (46.1%) were classified with WGS and 1131 (53.9%) with SGTF. Individuals infected with the Delta variant were more frequently vaccinated 162 (12%) than individuals infected with the Alpha variant 38 (5%). We report a statistically significant higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough for partial (OR=1.70; CI95% 1.18 to 2.47) and complete vaccination (OR=1.96; CI95% 1.22 to 3.14) in the Delta cases when compared to the Alpha cases, suggesting lower mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Delta cases. On our secondary analysis, we observed lower mean Ct values for the Delta VOC cases versus Alpha, regardless the vaccination status. Additionally, the Delta variant cases revealed a Ct-value mean increase of 2.24 (CI95% 0.85 to 3.64) between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated breakthrough cases contrasting with 4.49 (CI95% 2.07 to 6.91) in the Alpha VOC, suggesting a lower impact of vaccine on viral load of Delta cases. Conclusions: We found significantly higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough in Delta cases when compared to Alpha cases, suggesting lower effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in preventing infection with the Delta variant. Additionally, the vaccine breakthrough cases are estimated to be of higher mean Ct values, suggesting higher infectiousness with the Delta variant infection. These findings can help decision-makers weigh on the application or lifting of control measures and adjusting vaccine roll-out depending on the predominance of the Delta variant and the coverage of partial and complete mRNA vaccination.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2
123	10.1101/2021.08.17.21260128	Background The Alpha (B.1.1.7) SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern has been associated with increased transmission and increased 28-day mortality. We aimed to investigate the impact of infection on clinical severity of illness, including the need for oxygen or ventilation in a national cohort study. Methods In this prospective clinical cohort study, 1475 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from patients infected in Scotland, UK between the 1st November 2020 and 30th January 2021 and matched to clinical outcomes as the lineage became dominant in Scotland. We modelled the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease using a cumulative generalised linear mixed model employing a 4-point scale of maximum severity based on requirement of respiratory support at 28 days. We also estimated the growth rate of B.1.1.7-associated infections as it emerged in Scotland using a phylogenetic exponential growth rate population model. Results The B.1.1.7 lineage was responsible for a third wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Scotland in association with a transmission rate 5-fold higher than the preceding second wave B.1.177 lineage. Of 1475 patients, 364 were infected with B.1.1.7, 1030 with B.1.177 and 81 with other lineages. Our analysis found a positive association between increased clinical severity and lineage (B.1.1.7 versus non-B.1.1.7; cumulative odds ratio: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.93). Viral load was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) value (mean Ct change: -2.46, 95% CI: -4.22, -0.70). Conclusions The B.1.1.7 lineage was associated with more severe clinical disease in Scottish patients than co-circulating lineages.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
124	10.1101/2021.10.05.463185	A new challenge has immerged in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in worldwide. Rapid genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has been a powerful tool to study the pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.During this pandemic situation more genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 should be done in order to detect the mutations and genomic modifications across the globe. Here, in this study we have sequenced 23 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from the state of Uttar Pradesh, India collected during the first pandemic. A range of 2-22 mutations were observed including D614G, L452R, Q613H, Q677H, T1027I in S gene, S194L in N gene, Q57H, L106F, T175I in ORF3a gene as reported previously and also possible novel mutations like P309S in ORF1ab gene, T379I in N gene and L52F, V77I in ORF3a gene were detected.Phylogenetic genome analysis has shown similarity with other SARS-CoV-2 viruses reported in Uttar Pradesh. Mutations in these genes have the potential to affect the severity of the disease. Therefore, identify the mutation is very important to know the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 virus.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G, SPIKE_L452R, SPIKE_Q613H, SPIKE_Q677H, SPIKE_T1027I, N_S194L, ORF3A_Q57H, ORF3A_L106F, ORF3A_T175I, ORF1AB_P309S, N_T379I, ORF3A_L52F, ORF3A_V77I
125	10.1101/2021.10.06.21264467	Background The Delta (B.1.617.2) SARSCoV2 variant became the predominant UK circulating strain in May 2021. Whether COVID19 from Delta infection differs to infection with other variants in children is unknown. Methods Through the prospective COVID Symptom Study, 109,626 UK school-aged children were proxy-reported between December 28, 2020 and July 8, 2021. We selected all symptomatic children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were proxy-reported at least weekly, within two timeframes: December 28, 2020 to May 6, 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) the main UK circulating variant); and May 26 to July 8, 2021 (Delta the main UK circulating variant). We assessed illness profiles (symptom prevalence, duration, and burden), hospital presentation, and presence of long (>28 day) illness; and calculated odds ratios for symptoms presenting within the first 28 days of illness. Findings 694 (276 younger [5 11 years], 418 older [12 17 years]) symptomatic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with Alpha infection and 706 (227 younger and 479 older) children with Delta infection. Median illness duration was short with either variant (overall cohort: 5 days (IQR 2 9.75) with Alpha, 5 days (IQR 2 9) with Delta). The seven most prevalent symptoms were common to both variants. Symptom burden over the first 28 days was slightly greater with Delta compared with Alpha infection (in younger children, 3 (IQR 2 5) with Alpha, 4 (IQR 2 7) with Delta; in older children 5 (IQR 3 8) with Alpha and 6 (IQR 3 9) with Delta infection in older children). The odds of several symptoms were higher with Delta than Alpha infection, including headache and fever. Few children presented to hospital, and long illness duration was uncommon, with either variant. Interpretation COVID-19 in UK school-aged children due to SARSCoV2 Delta strain B.1.617.2 resembles illness due to the Alpha variant B.1.1.7., with short duration and similar symptom burden.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2, B.1.1.7
126	10.1101/2021.11.04.467077	There is an urgent need for potent and selective antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Pfizer developed PF-07321332 (PF-332), a potent inhibitor of the viral main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) that can be dosed orally and that is in clinical development. We here report that PF-332 exerts equipotent in vitro activity against the four SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VoC) and that it can completely arrest replication of the alpha variant in primary human airway epithelial cells grown at the air-liquid interface. Treatment of Syrian Golden hamsters with PF-332 (250 mg/kg, twice daily) completely protected the animals against intranasal infection with the beta (B.1.351) and delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variants. Moreover, treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.617.2) infected animals with PF-332 completely prevented transmission to untreated co-housed sentinels.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2, B.1.351, ALPHA
127	10.1101/2021.11.18.469065	SARS-CoV-2 has considerably higher mutation rate. SARS-CoV-2 possesses a RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which helps to replicate its genome. The mutation P323L in RdRp is associated with the loss of a particular epitope (321-327) from this protein which may influence the pathogenesis of the concern SARS-CoV-2 through the development of antibody escape variants. We consider the effect of mutations in some of the epitope regions including the naturally occurring mutation P323L on the structure of the epitope and their interface with paratope using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. P323L mutations cause conformational changes in the epitope region by opening up the region associated with increase in the radius of gyration and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, making the region less accessible. Moreover, the fluctuations in the dihedral angles in the epitope:paratope (IgG) interface increase which destabilize the interface. Such mutations may help in escaping antibody mediated immunity of the host.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_P323L
128	10.1101/2021.11.24.21266748	Background The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant became the predominant UK circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain in May 2021. How Delta infection compares with previous variants is unknown. Methods This prospective observational cohort study assessed symptomatic adults participating in the app-based COVID Symptom Study who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from May 26 to July 1, 2021 (Delta overwhelmingly predominant circulating UK variant), compared (1:1, age- and sex-matched) with individuals presenting from December 28, 2020 to May 6, 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) predominant variant). We assessed illness (symptoms, duration, presentation to hospital) during Alpha- and Delta-predominant timeframes; and transmission, reinfection, and vaccine effectiveness during the Delta-predominant period. Findings 3,581 individuals (aged 18 to 100 years) from each timeframe were assessed. The seven most frequent symptoms were common to both variants. Within the first 28 days of illness, some symptoms were more common with Delta vs. Alpha infection (including fever, sore throat and headache) and vice versa (dyspnoea). Symptom burden in the first week was higher with Delta vs. Alpha infection; however, the odds of any given symptom lasting [≥]7 days was either lower or unchanged. Illness duration [≥]28 days was lower with Delta vs. Alpha infection, though unchanged in unvaccinated individuals. Hospitalisation for COVID-19 was unchanged. The Delta variant appeared more (1.47) transmissible than Alpha. Re-infections were low in all UK regions. Vaccination markedly (69-84%) reduced risk of Delta infection. Interpretation COVID-19 from Delta or Alpha infections is clinically similar. The Delta variant is more transmissible than Alpha; however, current vaccines show good efficacy against disease.

129	10.1101/2021.12.06.471377	SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein to the peptidase domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in host cells. Recently detected Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.529) is heavily mutated on RBD. Currently, the most common Omicron variants are the original BA.1 Omicron strain and the BA.2 variant, which became more prevalent since it first appeared. To investigate how these mutations affect RBD-PD interactions, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the BA.1 and BA.2 RBD-PD in the presence of full-length glycans, explicit water and ions. Simulations revealed that RBDs of BA.1 and BA.2 variants exhibit a more dispersed interaction network and make an increased number of salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions with PD compared to wild-type RBD. Although BA.1 and BA.2 differ in two residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface, no major difference in RBD-PD interactions and binding strengths were observed between these variants. Using the conformations sampled in each trajectory, the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method estimated ~34% and ~51% stronger binding free energies for BA.1 and BA.2 RBD, respectively, than wild-type RBD, which may result in higher binding efficiency of the Omicron variant to infect host cells.	mutation_name_list: BA.1, BA.2
130	10.1101/2021.12.07.21267431	In 2021, Delta has become the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant worldwide. While vaccines effectively prevent COVID-19 hospitalization and death, vaccine breakthrough infections increasingly occur. The precise role of clinical and genomic determinants in Delta infections is not known, and whether they contribute to increased rates of breakthrough infections compared to unvaccinated controls. Here, we show a steep and near complete replacement of circulating variants with Delta between May and August 2021 in metropolitan New York. We observed an increase of the Delta sublineage AY.25, its spike mutation S112L, and nsp12 mutation F192V in breakthroughs. Delta infections were associated with younger age and lower hospitalization rates than Alpha. Delta breakthroughs increased significantly with time since vaccination, and, after adjusting for confounders, they rose at similar rates as in unvaccinated individuals. Our data indicate a limited impact of vaccine escape in favor of Delta’s increased epidemic growth in times of waning vaccine protection.	mutation_name_list: DELTA
131	10.1101/2021.12.14.472704	The recent emergence of the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with large numbers of mutations has raised concern about a potential new surge in infections. Here we use molecular dynamics to study the biophysics of the interface of the omicron spike protein binding to (i) the ACE2 receptor protein, (ii) antibodies from all known binding regions, and (iii) the furin binding domain. Our simulations suggest that while there is significant reduction of antibody binding strength corresponding to escape, the omicron spike pays a cost in terms of weaker receptor binding. The furin cleavage domain is the same or weaker binding than the alpha variant, suggesting less viral load and disease intensity than the extant delta variant.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON
132	10.1101/2021.12.17.473178	Mutations in the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have independently been shown to enhance aspects of spike protein fitness. Here, we report the discovery of a novel antibody fragment (VH ab6) that neutralizes all major variants, with a unique mode of binding revealed by cryo-EM studies. Further, we provide a comparative analysis of the mutational effects within variant spikes and identify the structural role of mutations within the NTD and RBD in evading antibody neutralization. Our analysis shows that the highly mutated Gamma N-terminal domain exhibits considerable structural rearrangements, partially explaining its decreased neutralization by convalescent sera. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the structural, functional, and antigenic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations and highlight a spike protein vulnerability that may be exploited to achieve broad protection against circulating variants.	mutation_name_list: GAMMA
133	10.1101/2021.12.24.474086	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) has exacerbated the COVID-19 pandemic. End of November 2021, a new SARS-CoV-2 variant namely the omicron (B.1.1.529) emerged. Since this omicron variant is heavily mutated in the spike protein, WHO classified this variant as the 5th variant of concern (VoC). We previously demonstrated that the other SARS-CoV-2 VoCs replicate efficiently in Syrian hamsters, alike also the ancestral strains. We here wanted to explore the infectivity of the omicron variant in comparison to the ancestral D614G strain. Strikingly, in hamsters that had been infected with the omicron variant, a 3 log10 lower viral RNA load was detected in the lungs as compared to animals infected with D614G and no infectious virus was detectable in this organ. Moreover, histopathological examination of the lungs from omicron-infecetd hamsters revealed no signs of peri-bronchial inflammation or bronchopneumonia. Further experiments are needed to determine whether the omicron VoC replicates possibly more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract of hamsters than in their lungs.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.529
134	10.1101/2021.12.27.474273	The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become the dominant infective strain and the focus efforts against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here we report an extensive set of structures of the Omicron spike trimer by its own or in complex with ACE2 and an anti-Omicron antibody. These structures reveal that most Omicron mutations are located on the surface of the spike protein, which confer stronger ACE2 binding by nearly 10 folds but become inactive epitopes resistant to many therapeutic antibodies. Importantly, both RBD and the closed conformation of the Omicron spike trimer are thermodynamically unstable, with the melting temperature of the Omicron RBD decreased by as much as 7°C, making the spiker trimer prone to random open conformations. An unusual RBD-RBD interaction in the ACE2-spike complex unique to Omicron is observed to support the open conformation and ACE2 binding, serving the basis for the higher infectivity of Omicron. A broad-spectrum therapeutic antibody JMB2002, which has completed Phase 1 clinical trial, is found to interact with the same two RBDs to inhibit ACE2 binding, in a mode that is distinguished from all previous antibodies, thus providing the structural basis for the potent inhibition of Omicron by this antibody. Together with biochemical data, our structures provide crucial insights into higher infectivity, antibody evasion and inhibition of Omicron.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON

136	10.1101/2022.01.12.476031	The newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant first identified in South Africa in November 2021 is characterized by an unusual number of amino acid mutations in its spike that renders existing vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies dramatically less effective. The in vivo pathogenicity, transmissibility, and fitness of this new Variant of Concerns are unknown. We investigated these virological attributes of the Omicron variant in comparison with those of the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in the golden Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron-infected hamsters developed significantly less body weight losses, clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine/chemokine dysregulation, and tissue damages than Delta-infected hamsters. The Omicron and Delta variant were both highly transmissible (100% vs 100%) via contact transmission. Importantly, the Omicron variant consistently demonstrated about 10-20% higher transmissibility than the already-highly transmissible Delta variant in repeated non-contact transmission studies (overall: 30/36 vs 24/36, 83.3% vs 66.7%). The Delta variant displayed higher fitness advantage than the Omicron variant without selection pressure in both in vitro and in vivo competition models. However, this scenario drastically changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies active against the Delta variant but poorly active against the Omicron variant were introduced, with the Omicron variant significantly outcompeting the Delta variant. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that while the Omicron variant is less pathogenic than the Delta variant, it is highly transmissible and can outcompete the Delta variant under immune selection pressure. Next-generation vaccines and antivirals effective against this new VOC are urgently needed. One Sentence Summary The novel SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, though less pathogenic, is highly transmissible and outcompetes the Delta variant under immune selection pressure in the golden Syrian hamster COVID-19 model.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.529, B.1.617.2, B.1..1529
137	10.1101/2022.01.13.22269234	The aim of the present paper is to highlight that new variants, either of higher viral load such as delta or higher contagiousness like omicron, lead to an even higher airborne transmission than historical strains. We first review the question of the route of contamination and of the dose following exposure, and the importance of the counting unit for pathogens, itself linked to the dose-response law. Using the counting unit of Wells, i.e. the quantum of contagium, we develop the conservation equation of quanta which allows deriving the value of the quantum concentration at steady state for a well-mixed room. With the choice of an exponential response function, this leads to the famous Wells-Riley equation. The analysis points out the importance of a number of parameters such as the time of exposure, the quantum production rate, mask wearing and the incidence rate in the population in order to evaluate the risk. The link with the monitoring concentration of carbon dioxide is made and used for a risk analysis of a variety of situations for which we have made concrete CO2 time monitoring. The main conclusion of these observations is that the present norms of ventilation, already insufficient, are not respected, especially in a variety of public premises, leading to high risk of contamination. Finally, we insist that public health policy in the field of airborne transmission should be based on a multi parameter analysis, considering the whole complexity of dose evaluation.	mutation_name_list: DELTA, OMICRON
138	10.1101/2022.01.20.477163	The amino acid (AA) mutations that characterise the different variants of concern (VOCs), which replaced the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate worldwide, provide biological advantages such as increased infectivity and partial escape from humoral immunity. Here we analysed the impact of these mutations on vaccination- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells. We confirmed that, in the majority of infected or vaccinated individuals, different mutations present in a single VOC (Delta) or a combined mosaic of more than 30 AA substitutions and deletions found in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron VOCs cause modest alteration in the global Spike-specific T cell response. However, distinct numerically dominant Spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells preferentially targeted regions affected by AA mutations and do not recognise the mutated peptides. Importantly, some of these mutations, such as N501Y (present in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron) and L452R (present in Delta), known to provide biological advantage to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of infectivity also abolished CD8 T cell recognition. Taken together, our data show that while global mRNA vaccine- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells largely tolerate the diverse mutations present in VOCs, single Spike-specific T cells might contribute to the natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 variants.	mutation_name_list: ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA, DELTA, OMICRON, SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_L452R
139	10.1101/2022.01.31.22270206	The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of rapid antigen tests such as the Abbott BinaxNOWTM COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test. In winter of 2021-2022, the omicron variant surge made it quickly apparent that although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are less sensitive than qRT-PCR, the accessibility, ease of use, and rapid read-outs of RDTs made them a sought after and often sold-out item at local suppliers. Here, we sought to qualify the BinaxNOWTM test for use in our university testing program as a method to rule in positive or rule out negative individuals quickly when they sought care at our priority qRT-PCR testing site. To perform this qualification study, we collected matched additional swabs from individuals attending this test site for standard of care qRT-PCR testing. All matched swabs were tested using the BinaxNOWTM RDT. 48 of 110 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All samples for which genome sequence could be collected were omicron (41). We observed a calculated sensitivity of 52.1%, specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 72.9% for the BinaxNOWTM tests (n=110). Sensitivity was improved (75.7%) by changing the qRT-PCR positivity threshold from a CT of 40 to a CT of 30. The ROC curve shows that for qRT-PCR positive CT values between 23-40, the BinaxNOWTM test is of limited value diagnostically. Our results suggest that RDT tests could be used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with substantial viral load, but that a significant fraction of infected individuals would be missed if we used RDT tests exclusively at this time.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON
140	10.1101/2022.02.06.22270558	Objectives: To characterize the clinical severity of COVID-19 caused by Omicron, Delta, and Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variants among hospitalized adults and to compare the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to prevent hospitalizations caused by each variant. Design: A case-control study of 11,690 hospitalized adults. Setting: Twenty-one hospitals across the United States. Participants: This study included 5728 cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and 5962 controls hospitalized without COVID-19. Cases were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: Alpha (March 11 to July 3, 2021), Delta (July 4 to December 25, 2021), and Omicron (December 26, 2021 to January 14, 2022). Main Outcome Measures: Vaccine effectiveness was calculated using a test-negative design for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations by each variant (Alpha, Delta, Omicron). Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, disease severity on the WHO Clinical Progression Ordinal Scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. Results: Vaccine effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations included: 85% (95% CI: 82 to 88%) for 2 vaccine doses against Alpha; 85% (95% CI: 83 to 87%) for 2 doses against Delta; 94% (95% CI: 92 to 95%) for 3 doses against Delta; 65% (95% CI: 51 to 75%) for 2 doses against Omicron; and 86% (95% CI: 77 to 91%) for 3 doses against Omicron. Among hospitalized unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, severity on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale was higher for Delta than Alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio [aPOR] 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for Omicron than Delta (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77). Compared to unvaccinated cases, severity was lower for vaccinated cases for each variant, including Alpha (aPOR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.49), Delta (aPOR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.51), and Omicron (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.85). Conclusions: mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations from Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against Omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against Delta and Alpha. Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, Omicron caused less severe disease than Delta, but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON, DELTA, ALPHA
141	10.1101/2022.02.14.480347	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant is replacing Delta, the most prevalent variant worldwide from the beginning of 2021 until early 2022. The Omicron variant is highly transmissible and responsible for a new worldwide COVID-19 wave. Herein, we calculated molecular dynamics simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (wild type, WT) and the Omicron variant of concern. Structural analyses reveal that the SpikeOmicron presents more conformational flexibility than SpikeWT, mainly in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such flexibility results in a broader spectrum of different conformations for SpikeOmicron, whereby the RBD can more easily visit an up-conformational state. We reported how the mutations in this variant may influence the intra- and inter-protomer contacts caused by conformational flexibility. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the differences in conformational flexibility between SpikeOmicron and SpikeWT may explain the observed gains in infectivity, immune system evasion and transmissibility in this novel variant.

142	10.1101/2022.02.15.480592	Hyper-transmissibility with decreased disease severity are typical characteristics of Omicron variant. To understand this phenomenon, we used various bioinformatics approaches to analyze randomly selected genome sequences (one each) of the Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants submitted to NCBI from 15 to 31 December 2021. We show that: (i) Pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants decreases in the order: Wuhan > Gamma > Delta > Omicron; however, the antigenic property follows the order: Omicron > Gamma > Wuhan > Delta. (ii) Omicron Spike RBD has lower pathogenicity but higher antigenicity than other variants. (iii) Decreased disease severity by Omicron variant may be due to its decreased pro-inflammatory and IL-6 stimulation and increased IFN-γ and IL-4 induction efficacy. (iv) Mutations in N protein are associated with decreased IL-6 induction and human DDX21-mediated increased IL-4 production in Omicron. (v) Due to mutations, the stability of S, M, N, and E proteins decreases in the order: Omicron > Gamma > Delta > Wuhan. (vi) Stronger Spike RBD-hACE2 binding in Omicron is associated with increased transmissibility. However, the lowest stability of the Omicron Spike protein makes Spike RBD-hACE2 interaction weak for systemic infection and for causing severe disease. Finally (vii), the highest instability of Omicron E protein may also be associated with decreased viral maturation and low viral load leading to less severe disease and faster recovery. Our method may be used for other similar viruses, and these findings will contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the management of emerging variants.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON
143	10.1101/2022.02.22.21268475	Background: Clinical severity of patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron (fourth) wave was assessed and compared to trends in the D614G (first), Beta (second), and Delta (third) waves in South Africa. Methods: Weekly incidence of 30 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases/100,000 population defined the start and end of each wave. Hospital admission data were collected through an active national COVID-19-specific surveillance programme. Disease severity was compared across waves by post-imputation random effect multivariable logistic regression models. Severe disease was defined as one or more of acute respiratory distress, supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, intensive-care admission or death. Results: 335,219 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admissions were analysed, constituting 10.4% of 3,216,179 cases recorded during the 4 waves. In the Omicron wave, 8.3% of cases were admitted to hospital (52,038/629,617) compared to 12.9% (71,411/553,530) in the D614G, 12.6% (91,843/726,772) in the Beta and 10.0% (131,083/1,306,260) in the Delta waves (p<0.001). During the Omicron wave, 33.6% of admissions experienced severe disease compared to 52.3%, 63.4% and 63.0% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). The in-hospital case fatality ratio during the Omicron wave was 10.7%, compared to 21.5%, 28.8% and 26.4% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). Compared to the Omicron wave, patients had more severe clinical presentations in the D614G (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.13), Beta (aOR 3.59; CI: 3.49-3.70) and Delta (aOR 3.47: CI: 3.38-3.57) waves. Conclusion: The trend of increasing cases and admissions across South Africa's first three waves shifted in Omicron fourth wave, with a higher and quicker peak but fewer admitted patients, who experienced less clinically severe illness and had a lower case-fatality ratio. Omicron marked a change in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve, clinical profile and deaths in South Africa. Extrapolations to other populations should factor in differing vaccination and prior infection levels.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON, BETA, DELTA, SPIKE_D614G
144	10.1101/2022.02.22.481491	The recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern (VOC) containing a heavily mutated spike protein capable of escaping preexisting immunity, identifies a continued need for interventional measures. Molnupiravir (MK-4482), an orally administered nucleoside analog, has demonstrated efficacy against earlier SARS-CoV-2 lineages and was recently approved for SARS-CoV-2 infections in high-risk adults. Here we assessed the efficacy of MK-4482 against the earlier Alpha, Beta and Delta VOCs and Omicron in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron replication and associated lung disease in vehicle treated hamsters was reduced compared to the earlier VOCs. MK-4482 treatment inhibited virus replication in the lungs of Alpha, Beta and Delta VOC infected hamsters. Importantly, MK-4482 profoundly inhibited virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters infected with the Omicron VOC. Consistent with its mutagenic mechanism, MK-4482 treatment had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on infectious virus titers compared to viral RNA genome load. Histopathologic analysis showed that MK-4482 treatment caused a concomitant reduction in the level of lung disease and viral antigen load in infected hamsters across all VOCs examined. Together, our data indicate the potential of MK-4482 as an effective antiviral against known SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, especially Omicron, and likely future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

145	10.1101/2022.02.23.481492	We apply our mechanistic, within-host, pre-immunity, respiratory tract infection model for unvaccinated, previously uninfected, and immune-compromised individuals. Starting from published cell infection and viral replication data for the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant, we explore variability in outcomes of viral load and cell infection due to three plausible mechanisms altered by SARS-CoV-2 mutations of delta and omicron. We seek a mechanistic explanation of clinical test results: delta nasal infections express ∼3 orders-of-magnitude higher viral load than alpha, while omicron infections express an additional 1 to 2 orders-of-magnitude rise over delta. Model simulations reveal shortening of the eclipse phase (the time between cellular uptake of the virus and onset of infectious viral replication and shedding) alone can generate 3-5 orders-of-magnitude higher viral load within 2 days post initial infection. Higher viral replication rates by an infected cell can generate at most one order-of-magnitude rise in viral load, whereas higher cell infectability has minimal impact and lowers the viral load.	mutation_name_list: DELTA, OMICRON
146	10.1101/2022.03.01.22271582	Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection, including incubation period and transmission rates, distinguish this variant from preceding variants. However, whether the duration of shedding of viable virus differs between omicron and previous variants is not well understood. To characterize how variant and vaccination status impact shedding of viable virus, we serially sampled symptomatic outpatients newly diagnosed with COVID-19. Anterior nasal swabs were tested for viral load, sequencing, and viral culture. Time to PCR conversion was similar between individuals infected with the Delta and the Omicron variant. Time to culture conversion was also similar, with a median time to culture conversion of 6 days (interquartile range 4–8 days) in both groups. There were also no differences in time to PCR or culture conversion by vaccination status.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON
147	10.1101/2022.03.02.22271385	With the continuous emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and implementation of mass-scale interventions like vaccination, understanding factors affecting disease transmission has critical implications for control efforts. Here we used a simple adapted N95 mask sampling method to demonstrate the impact of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccination on 92 COVID-19 patients to expel virus into the air translating to a transmission risk. Between July and September 2021, when the Delta was the dominant circulating strain in Mumbai, we noted a two-fold increase in the proportion of people expelling virus (95%), about an eighty-fold increase in median viral load and a three-fold increase in high emitter type (41%; people expelling >1000 viral copy numbers in 30 minutes) compared to initial strains of 2020. Eight percent of these patients continued to be high emitters even after eight days of symptom onset, suggesting a probable increased transmission risk for Delta strain even at this stage. There was no significant difference in expelling pattern between partial, full and un-vaccinated individuals suggesting similar transmission risk. We noted significantly more infections among vaccinated study patients and their household members than unvaccinated, probably due to increased duration from vaccination and/or increased risk behaviour upon vaccination due to lower perceived threat. This study provides biological evidence for possible continued transmission of the Delta strain even with vaccination, emphasizing the need to continue COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The study also indicates that the mask method may be useful for screening future vaccine candidates, therapeutics or interventions for their ability to block transmission.	mutation_name_list: DELTA
148	10.1101/2022.03.02.22271771	BACKGROUND: Qatar experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) wave that started on December 19, 2021 and peaked in mid-January, 2022. We investigated effects of Omicron subvariant (BA.1 and BA.2), previous vaccination, and prior infection on infectiousness of Omicron infections, between December 23, 2021 and February 20, 2022. METHODS: Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to estimate the association between the RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR tests (a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness) and each of the Omicron subvariants, mRNA vaccination, prior infection, reason for RT-qPCR testing, calendar week of RT-qPCR testing (to account for phases of the rapidly evolving Omicron wave), and demographic factors. RESULTS: Compared to BA.1, BA.2 was associated with 3.53 fewer cycles (95% CI: 3.46-3.60), signifying higher infectiousness. Ct value decreased with time since second and third vaccinations. Ct values were highest for those who received their boosters in the month preceding the RT-qPCR test - 0.86 cycles (95% CI: 0.72-1.00) higher than for unvaccinated persons. Ct value was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.20-1.39) cycles higher for those with a prior infection compared to those without prior infection, signifying lower infectiousness. Ct value declined gradually with age. Ct value was lowest for those who were tested because of symptoms and was highest for those who were tested for travel-related purposes. Ct value was lowest during the exponential-growth phase of the Omicron wave and was highest after the wave peaked and was declining. CONCLUSIONS: The BA.2 subvariant appears substantially more infectious than the BA.1 subvariant. This may reflect higher viral load and/or longer duration of infection, thereby explaining the rapid expansion of this subvariant in Qatar.	mutation_name_list: BA.1, BA.2
149	10.1101/2022.03.02.482662	Coronavirus disease 2019 continues to batter the world with the unceasing introduction of new variants of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. In order to understand differences in disease caused by variants of concern and to develop variant-specific vaccines, suitable small animal models are required that mimic disease progression in humans at various stages of life. In this study, we compared the dynamics of infection with two SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Delta and Omicron) in aged (>1 year 3 months old) and young (<5 weeks old) Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We show that no weight loss occurred in Omicron infected groups regardless of age, while infection with the Delta variant caused weight loss of up to 10% by day 7 post-infection with slower and incomplete recovery in the aged group. Omicron replicated to similar levels as Delta in the lungs, trachea and nasal turbinates, with no significant differences in the tissue viral loads of aged versus young animals for either variant. In contrast to rare necrosis observed in Omicron-infected animals regardless of age, severe necrosis was observed in the olfactory epithelium in Delta-infected animals. Omicron infection also resulted in mild pulmonary disease in both young and aged animals compared to the moderate acute necrotizing bronchointerstitial pneumonia seen in Delta-infected animals. These results suggest that Omicron infection results in an attenuated clinical disease outlook in Syrian hamsters compared to infection with the Delta variant irrespective of age.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON, DELTA
150	10.1101/2022.04.05.487114	The efforts of the scientific community to tame the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic seems to have been diluted by the emergence of new viral strains. Therefore, it becomes imperative to study and understand the effect of mutations on viral evolution, fitness and pathogenesis. In this regard, we performed a time-series analysis on 59541 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from around the world. These 59541 genomes were grouped according to the months (January 2020-March 2021) based on the collection date. Meta-analysis of this data led us to identify highly significant mutations in viral genomes. Correlation and Hierarchical Clustering of the highly significant mutations led us to the identification of sixteen mutation pairs that were correlated with each other and were present in >30% of the genomes under study. Among these mutation pairs, some of the mutations have been shown to contribute towards the viral replication and fitness suggesting the possible role of other unexplored mutations in viral evolution and pathogenesis. Additionally, we employed various computational tools to investigate the effects of T85I, P323L, and Q57H mutations in Non-structural protein 2 (Nsp2), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Open reading frame 3a (ORF3a) respectively. Results show that T85I in Nsp2 and Q57H in ORF3a mutations are deleterious and destabilize the parent protein whereas P323L in RdRp is neutral and has a stabilizing effect. The normalized linear mutual information (nLMI) calculations revealed the significant residue correlation in Nsp2 and ORF3a in contrast to reduce correlation in RdRp protein.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_P323L, NSP2_T85I, ORF3A_Q57H

152	10.1111/1751-7915.14064	Summary The Omicron variant rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain in South Africa and elsewhere. This review explores whether this rise was due to an increased transmission of the variant or its escape from population immunity by an extensively mutated spike protein. The mutations affected the structure of the spike protein leading to the loss of neutralization by most, but not all, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Omicron also shows substantial immune escape from serum antibodies in convalescent patients and vaccinees. A booster immunization increased, however, the titre and breadth of antiviral antibody response. The cellular immune response against Omicron was largely preserved explaining a satisfying protection of boosted vaccinees against severe infections. Clinicians observed less severe infection with Omicron, but other scientists warned that this must not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed a lesser virulence than previous VOCs and lung functions were less compromised. Cell biologists demonstrated that Omicron differs from Delta by preferring the endocytic pathway for cell entry over fusion with the plasma membrane which might explain Omicron?s distinct replication along the respiratory tract compared with Delta. Omicron represents a distinct evolutionary lineage that deviated from the mainstream of evolving SARS-CoV-2 already in mid-2020 raising questions about where it circulated before getting widespread in December 2021. The role of Omicron for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON

Certainly, Clinicians worldwide are facing new and enormous challenges when considering patients with suspected COVID-19; unfortunately, while the situation in China and Eastern Asia has shown a reduction in the number of new diagnosis in the last couple of weeks, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Europe, and in particular in Italy, has seen a dramatic increase, with more than 160'000 cases and '20'000 deaths as of April 14, 2020 [3].

Early work suggests that infections caused by the Omicron variant may be less severe than those caused by the Delta variant. We sought to compare clinical outcomes of infections caused by these two strains, confirmed by whole genome sequencing, over a short period of time, from respiratory samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at a large medical center. We found that infections caused by the Omicron variant caused significantly less morbidity, including admission to the hospital and requirement for oxygen supplementation, and significantly less mortality than those caused by the Delta variant.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON
156	10.1126/science.abf4058	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins interact with the eukaryotic translation machinery, and inhibitors of translation have potent antiviral effects. We found that the drug plitidepsin (aplidin), which has limited clinical approval, possesses antiviral activity (90% inhibitory concentration = 0.88 nM) that is more potent than remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by a factor of 27.5, with limited toxicity in cell culture. Through the use of a drug-resistant mutant, we show that the antiviral activity of plitidepsin against SARS-CoV-2 is mediated through inhibition of the known target eEF1A (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A). We demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of plitidepsin treatment in two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a reduction of viral replication in the lungs by two orders of magnitude using prophylactic treatment. Our results indicate that plitidepsin is a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.	mutation_name_list:

Twenty drugs significantly inhibited replication of both viruses in vitro. Eight of these drugs inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro, with the most potent being masitinib, an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor. X-ray crystallography and biochemistry show that masitinib acts as a competitive inhibitor of 3CLpro. Mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then treated with masitinib showed >200-fold reduction in viral titers in the lungs and nose, as well as reduced lung inflammation.

We report here cryo-EM structures of the full-length spike (S) trimers of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, as well as their biochemical and antigenic properties. Amino acid substitutions in the B.1.1.7 protein increase the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and also the binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced receptor engagement may account for the increased transmissibility. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the major neutralizing sites on the S protein, making it resistant to some potent neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide structural details on how SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to enhance viral fitness and immune evasion.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351
159	10.1126/science.abn8652	The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern evades antibody-mediated immunity that comes from vaccination or infection with earlier variants due to accumulation of numerous spike mutations. To understand the Omicron antigenic shift, we determined cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystal structures of the spike protein and the receptor-binding domain bound to the broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody (mAb) S309 (the parent mAb of sotrovimab) and to the human ACE2 receptor. We provide a blueprint for understanding the marked reduction of binding of other therapeutic mAbs that leads to dampened neutralizing activity. Remodeling of interactions between the Omicron receptor-binding domain and human ACE2 likely explains the enhanced affinity for the host receptor relative to the ancestral virus.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON
160	10.1128/jvi.00203-08	Sequencing and reversion analysis of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) temperature-sensitive (ts) viruses has identified putative ts mutations in the replicase nonstructural proteins (nsp's) of these coronaviruses. In this study, reverse transcriptase PCR sequencing of the RNA genome of an isolate of the MHV ts virus Alb ts6, referred to as Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A, identified a putative ts mutation in nsp5 (T10651C, Val148Ala), the viral 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro). The introduction of the T10651C mutation into the infectious MHV clone resulted in the recovery of a mutant virus, the nsp5/V148A virus, that demonstrated reduced growth and nsp5 proteinase activity identical to that of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A at the nonpermissive temperature. Sequence analysis of 40 degrees C revertants of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A identified primary reversion to Ala148Val in nsp5, as well as two independent second-site mutations resulting in Ser133Asn and His134Tyr substitutions in nsp5. The introduction of the Ser133Asn or His134Tyr substitution into the cloned nsp5/V148A mutant virus background resulted in the recovery of viruses with increased growth fitness and the partial restoration of nsp5 activity at the nonpermissive temperature. Modeling of the nsp5 structure of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A predicted that the Val148Ala mutation alters residue 148 interactions with residues of the substrate binding S1 subsite of the nsp5 active-site cavity. This study identifies novel residues in nsp5 that may be important for regulating substrate specificity and nsp5 proteinase activity.	mutation_name_list: 
161	10.1128/msystems.00030-21	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in 92 million cases in a span of 1 year. The study focuses on understanding population-specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions particularly in the United States. Rigorous phylogenomic network analysis of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (245) inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d, and e (subtypes e1 and e2). Clade d and subclade e2 were found exclusively comprised of U.S. strains. Clades were distinguished by 10 co-mutational combinations in Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2, and Nsp6. Our analysis revealed that only 67.46% of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations were at the amino acid level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase protein stability in 238 strains except for 6 strains which were marked as ancestral type, whereas co-mutation (P409L and Y446C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes from the United States highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking highlighted mutation (D614G) caused reduction in binding of spike proteins with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but it also showed better interaction with the TMPRSS2 receptor contributing to high transmissibility among U.S. strains. We also found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B, and MYO5C, that had maximum interaction with viral proteins (nucleocapsid [N], spike [S], and membrane [M] proteins). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO5 proteins which could be an effective target for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. The functional annotations of the host-pathogen interaction (HPI) network were found to be closely associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions, confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection. We also screened CpG islands in Nsp1 and N conferring the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger zinc antiviral protein (ZAP) activity inside the host cell. IMPORTANCE In the current study, we presented a global view of mutational pattern observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. This provided a who-infect-whom geographical model since the early pandemic. This is hitherto the most comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of full-length genomes for co-mutations at different geographical regions especially in U.S. strains. Compositional structural biology results suggested that mutations have a balance of opposing forces affecting pathogenicity suggesting that only a few mutations are effective at the translation level. Novel HPI analysis and CpG predictions elucidate the proof of concept of hypoxia and thrombotic conditions in several patients. Thus, the current study focuses the understanding of population-specific variations attributing a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in specific geographical regions which may eventually be vital for the most severely affected countries and regions for sharp development of custom-made vindication strategies.	mutation_name_list: NSP3_T1103P, SPIKE_D614G
162	10.1128/spectrum.02732-21	The process of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic diversification is still ongoing and has very recently led to the emergence of a new variant of concern (VOC), defined as Omicron or B.1.1.529. Omicron VOC is the most divergent variant identified so far and has generated immediate concern for its potential capability to increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and, more worryingly, to escape therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies. Nevertheless, a clear definition of the Omicron VOC mutational spectrum is still missing. Herein, we provide a comprehensive definition and functional characterization (in terms of infectivity and/or antigenicity) of mutations characterizing the Omicron VOC. In particular, 887,475 SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC whole-genome sequences were retrieved from the GISAID database and used to precisely define its specific patterns of mutations across the different viral proteins. In addition, the functional characterization of Omicron VOC spike mutations was finely discussed according to published manuscripts. Lastly, residues characterizing the Omicron VOC and the previous four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) were mapped on the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to assess their localization in the different spike domains. Overall, our study will assist with deciphering the Omicron VOC mutational profile and will shed more light on its clinical implications. This is critical considering that Omicron VOC is currently the predominant variant worldwide. IMPORTANCE The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) has a peculiar spectrum of mutations characterized by the acquisition of mutations or deletions rarely detected in previously identified variants, particularly in the spike glycoprotein. Such mutations, mostly residing in the receptor-binding domain, could play a pivotal role in enhancing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity (by increasing binding affinity for ACE2), jeopardizing spike recognition by therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies and causing diagnostic assay failure. To our knowledge, this is one of the first exhaustive descriptions of newly emerged mutations underlying the Omicron VOC and its biological and clinical implications.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.529
163	10.1136/bmj-2021-069761	OBJECTIVES: To characterize the clinical severity of covid-19 associated with the alpha, delta, and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants among adults admitted to hospital and to compare the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines to prevent hospital admissions related to each variant. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 21 hospitals across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 11 690 adults (≥18 years) admitted to hospital: 5728 with covid-19 (cases) and 5962 without covid-19 (controls). Patients were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and, if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: alpha (11 March to 3 July 2021), delta (4 July to 25 December 2021), and omicron (26 December 2021 to 14 January 2022). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness calculated using a test negative design for mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 related hospital admissions by each variant (alpha, delta, omicron). Among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, disease severity on the World Health Organization’s clinical progression scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. RESULTS: Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON, DELTA, ALPHA
164	10.1172/jci.insight.155483	Isolation guidelines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are largely derived from data collected prior to the emergence of the delta variant. We followed a cohort of ambulatory patients with postvaccination breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections with longitudinal collection of nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification, whole-genome sequencing, and viral culture. All delta variant infections in our cohort were symptomatic, compared with 64% of non-delta variant infections. Symptomatic delta variant breakthrough infections were characterized by higher initial viral load, longer duration of virologic shedding by PCR, greater likelihood of replication-competent virus at early stages of infection, and longer duration of culturable virus compared with non-delta variants. The duration of time since vaccination was also correlated with both duration of PCR positivity and duration of detection of replication-competent virus. Nonetheless, no individuals with symptomatic delta variant infections had replication-competent virus by day 10 after symptom onset or 24 hours after resolution of symptoms. These data support US CDC isolation guidelines as of November 2021, which recommend isolation for 10 days or until symptom resolution and reinforce the importance of prompt testing and isolation among symptomatic individuals with delta breakthrough infections. Additional data are needed to evaluate these relationships among asymptomatic and more severe delta variant breakthrough infections.	mutation_name_list: DELTA
165	10.1248/bpb.b21-01081	A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain, the Omicron variant (Pango lineage B.1.1.529), was identified in South Africa in late September 2021. This variant has multiple spike protein deletions and mutations, with 15 amino acid substitutions detected in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These RBD substitutions are hypothesized to increase infectivity and reduce antibody affinity, which is supported by recent data showing that the Omicron variant spreads faster than the Delta variant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2). Thus, this increase in infectivity should lead to Omicron being the dominant variant and developing screening tests that discriminate between Omicron and Delta variants is urgently needed. In this study, we successfully developed a novel screening assay using high-resolution melting analysis, in which two genotypes at G446/L452 and S477/T478 RBD were determined (G446S/L452 and S477N/T478K for Omicron; G446/L452R and S477/T478K for Delta). Using synthetic DNA fragments, we confirmed both melting point and melting peak shape of the RBD Omicron variant was distinguishable from those of wild-type and the Delta variant. Although this study was conducted without clinical samples, these results suggest that our HRM-based genotyping method can readily identify the Omicron and Delta variants. This simple method should contribute to the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants and thus prevent potential widespread infection and inflow of the Omicron variant.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.529, B.1.617.2
166	10.1371/journal.pbio.3001006	Since entering the human population, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID-19]) has spread worldwide, causing >100 million infections and >2 million deaths. While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether many of these changes impact adaptation, replication, or transmission of the virus. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, virus stocks, and passaging experiments, together with kinetic virus replication data from nonhuman Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells. Overall, our study uncovers sequence features in SARS-CoV-2 variants that determine cell-specific replication and highlights the need to monitor SARS-CoV-2 stocks carefully when phenotyping newly emerging variants or potential variants of concern.	mutation_name_list: NSP2_T85I, ORF3A_Q57H, SPIKE_D614G
167	10.1371/journal.pone.0238665	This study aims to highlight SARS-COV-2 mutations which are associated with increased or decreased viral virulence. We utilize genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries’ regional information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.	mutation_name_list: ORF3A_Q57H, N_P13L
168	10.1371/journal.pone.0247799	COVID-19 has greatly affected public health and world economy. In this study, we analyzed 129 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV-2 viruses of a Canadian population during early phase of the pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three major paths of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into Canada. Twenty-one substitutions that have frequencies greater than 3% of viral population were identified. Analysis of these substitutions indicated that P1427I (ORF1b), Y1464C (ORF1b), and Q57H (ORF3a) might affect functions of the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins. Additionally, we found the evidence of positive selection on the ORF3a and codon 614 of Spike protein, suggesting the viral components responsible for host entry and activation of inflammation response were targeted by host immune responses. The study showed genomic variation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a Canadian population. These information may help develop preventive strategies and be used for further study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and therapeutics development.	mutation_name_list: ORF3A_Q57H, ORF1B_P1427I, ORF1B_Y1464C
169	10.1371/journal.ppat.1009914	As novel SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, it is critical that their potential to cause severe disease and evade vaccine-induced immunity is rapidly assessed in humans and studied in animal models. In early January 2021, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and it was shown to have enhanced infectivity in vitro and decreased antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both variants exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1 (614G), with B.1.429 causing the most marked body weight loss among the 3 variants. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1. (614G) and B.1.427 infections. In addition, subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA) levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429, however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three variants. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1 (614G) or B.1.427 in the oropharynx but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments, we found that B.1. (614G), epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) and gamma (P.1) dramatically outcompete alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) and zeta (P.2) in the lungs. In the nasal cavity, B.1. (614G), gamma, and epsilon dominate, but the highly infectious alpha variant also maintains a moderate size niche. We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427, B.1.429 and ancestral B.1 (614G) and WA-1 variants in hamsters. These results demonstrate enhanced virulence and high relative oropharyngeal replication of the epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) variant in Syrian hamsters compared to an ancestral B.1 (614G) variant.	mutation_name_list: B.1.429, B.1.427, EPSILON, B.1, B.1.1.7
170	10.1371/journal.ppat.1010053	COVID-19 patients transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to minks in the Netherlands in April 2020. Subsequently, the mink-associated virus (miSARS-CoV-2) spilled back over into humans. Genetic sequences of the miSARS-CoV-2 identified a new genetic variant known as “Cluster 5” that contained mutations in the spike protein. However, the functional properties of these “Cluster 5” mutations have not been well established. In this study, we found that the Y453F mutation located in the RBD domain of miSARS-CoV-2 is an adaptive mutation that enhances binding to mink ACE2 and other orthologs of Mustela species without compromising, and even enhancing, its ability to utilize human ACE2 as a receptor for entry. Structural analysis suggested that despite the similarity in the overall binding mode of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human and mink ACE2, Y34 of mink ACE2 was better suited to interact with a Phe rather than a Tyr at position 453 of the viral RBD due to less steric clash and tighter hydrophobic-driven interaction. Additionally, the Y453F spike exhibited resistance to convalescent serum, posing a risk for vaccine development. Thus, our study suggests that since the initial transmission from humans, SARS-CoV-2 evolved to adapt to the mink host, leading to widespread circulation among minks while still retaining its ability to efficiently utilize human ACE2 for entry, thus allowing for transmission of the miSARS-CoV-2 back into humans. These findings underscore the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Mustela species and other susceptible hosts in order to prevent future outbreaks.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_Y453F
171	10.1503/cmaj.211248	BACKGROUND: Between February and June 2021, the initial wild-type strains of SARS-CoV-2 were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, by new variants of concern (VOCs), first those with the N501Y mutation (i.e., Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants) and then the Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. METHODS: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables. We adjusted models for age, sex, time, vaccination status, comorbidities and pregnancy status. We included health units as random intercepts. RESULTS: Our cohort included 212 326 people. Compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42%–63%) for hospitalization, 89% (95% CI 67%–117%) for ICU admission and 51% (95% CI 30%–78%) for death. Increased risk with the Delta variant was more pronounced at 108% (95% CI 78%–140%) for hospitalization, 235% (95% CI 160%–331%) for ICU admission and 133% (95% CI 54%–231%) for death. INTERPRETATION: The increasing virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will lead to a considerably larger, and more deadly, pandemic than would have occurred in the absence of the emergence of VOCs.	mutation_name_list: ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA, DELTA

It has also shown with high case-fatality rates, indeed to urgent prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Scientific advancements of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic allowed for rapid progress to understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. This review highlights the the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 with the proposed roles of genotype and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 in pathogenesis and discuss recent results supporting treatment strategies of COVID-19 with a special focus on how these new insights may facilitate rational development of SARS-CoV-2 for targeted therapies in the future.	mutation_name_list: 
173	10.21203/rs.3.rs-51012/v1	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), originally emerged from Wuhan, has caused an unprecedented worldwide pandemic in the first half of 2020. Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 on March 10 th , 2020 in Turkey, more than 150,000 people in the country have been infected with this virus. In this study, a total of 80 genomic virulent strains from Turkey which were uploaded in NCBI and GISAID database were analyzed with other genomic sequences from different countries with the aim to characterize notable genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 and to identify some novel mutations. Consistent with other studies, the combination of variants at positions C3037T, C14408T and A23403G were most common mutations (73%), that exist together in isolates from Turkey. Our secondary structure prediction analysis also highlighted 11 unique non-substitutional mutations from viral SARS-COV-2 isolates of Turkey in different regions such as in spike (S) protein and non-structural proteins (Nsp2, Nsp3, NSP4, and NSP12/RdRP). Of these 11 mutations, nine of them have been found to be involved in structural alterations at different sites. 3/9 mutants (A771V, T1238I and G1251V) cause alteration in structure of S protein, while the rest of them induces structural changes in Nsp2 (A206T, R207C, T265I), Nsp3 (A1824V), Nsp4 (M2796I) and NSP12 (A4489V). These mutations identified here might have significant functional implications that needs to be addressed for future studies in the context of vaccine engineering and therapeutic interventions. Moreover, transmission and phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple independent sources of introductions for infection of hCovs in Turkey and close phylogenetic relationship of Turkish strains with Saudi strains.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_A771V, SPIKE_T1238I, SPIKE_G1251V, NSP2_A206T, NSP2_R207C, NSP2_T265I, NSP3_A1824V, NSP4_M2796I, NSP12_A4489V
174	10.21203/rs.3.rs-535704/v1	Variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged which contain multiple substitutions in the surface spike glycoprotein that have been associated with increased transmission and resistance to neutralising antibodies and antisera. We have examined the structure and receptor binding properties of spike proteins from the B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (SA) variants to better understand the evolution of the virus in humans. Both variants’ spikes have the same mutation, N501Y, in their receptor-binding domains that confers tighter ACE2 binding and this substitution relies on a common earlier substitution (D614G) to achieve the tighter binding. Each variant spike has also acquired a key change in structure that impacts virus pathogenesis. Unlike other SARS-CoV-2 spikes, the spike from the UK variant is stable against detrimerisation on binding ACE2. This feature primarily arises from the acquisition of a substitution at the S1-S2 furin site that allows for near-complete cleavage. In the SA variant spike, the presence of a new substitution, K417N, again on the background of the D614G substitution, enables the spike trimer to adopt fully open conformations that are required for receptor binding. Both types of structural change likely contribute to the increased effectiveness of these viruses for infecting human cells.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y, B.1.1.7, SPIKE_K417N, B.1.351
175	10.21203/rs.3.rs-70482/v1	A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an “up” conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G
176	10.21203/rs.3.rs-877078/v1	Background: SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta coronavirus family responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic. The infection first emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide. The ongoing outbreak has posed an urgent worldwide health threat due to the rapid transmittable potential and high mortality rate. Due to the critical role of none structural protein − 12 (NSP-12) in COVID-19. This study tries to investigate the link between genotype-phenotype NSP-12 variation and the prevalence of this disease. Methods We analyzed approximately 2 million Nsp12 of SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence from January 2020 until June 2021. Python programming language was utilized to preprocess and apply inclusion criteria on FASTA files to prepare a list of suitable samples for clustering samples. NSP-12 regions were aligned to the reference sequence to compare and identify mutation patterns, categorized based on frequency and continent. Results The rate of ‌NSP-12 mutation in divided geographical areas was different. Based on continental studies, the P227L and G671S mutations have multiplied over time and in European and Asian societies in recent months. According to biochemical studies, the occurrence of G671S mutation increases the stability of the protein. Conclusion We concluded that NSP-12 P227L and G671S mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are increased in recent months. Further studies will be required to investigate whether these mutations impact the severity of the disease.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_G671S, NSP12_P227L
177	10.2139/ssrn.3861566	Background: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) on disease severity is unclear. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared outcomes of patients infected with B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 with those with wild-type strains from early 2020.Methods: National surveillance data from 1-January-2021 to 22-May-2021 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, and outcomes in relation to VOC were explored. Detailed patient level data from all SARS-CoV-2 patients with VOC infection admitted to our centre between 20-December-2020 and 12-May-2021 were analysed. Outcomes were compared with a cohort of 846 patients admitted January-April 2020.Findings: There were 838 VOC infections in Singapore in the study period. After adjusting for age and gender, B.1.617.2 infection was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or death (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4·90, [95% CI 1·43-30·78]. 157 patients with VOCs were admitted to our centre. After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and vaccination, aOR for pneumonia with B.1.617.2 was 1·88 [95% CI 0·95-3·76]) compared with wild-type. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and significantly longer duration of Ct value ≤30 (estimated median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2, 13 days for wild-type). Vaccine breakthrough cases were less severe.Interpretation: There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility. These findings provide a strong impetus for the rapid implementation of vaccination programmes.Funding Information: National Medical Research Council grants COVID19RF-001 and COVID19RF-008.Declaration of Interests: BEY reports personal fees from Roche and Sanofi, outside the submitted work.

178	10.22209/ic.v62s2a02	Variants of Concern of SARS-CoV-2 (VOCs), the new coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, have emerged in several countries. Mutations in the amino acid 484 of the Spike protein are particularly important and associated with some of these variants: E484K or E484Q. These mutations have been associated with evasion to neutralizing antibodies. Restriction enzyme analysis is proposed as a rapid method to detect these mutations. A search on GISAID was performed in April 2021 to detect the frequency of these two mutations in the sequence available and their association with other lineages. E484K, present in some VOCs, has emerged in several other lineages and is frequently found in recent viral isolates. A small amplicon from the Spike gene was digested with two enzymes: HpyAV, and MseI. The use of these two enzymes allows the detection of mutations at position 484, and to differentiate between these three conditions: non-mutated, and the presence of E484K or E484Q. A 100% correlation was observed with sequencing results. The proposed methodology, which allows for the screening of a great number of samples, will probably help to provide more information on the prevalence and epidemiology of these mutations worldwide, to select the candidates for whole-genome sequencing.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_E484K, SPIKE_E484Q
179	10.26355/eurrev_202112_27653	Recently a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from South Africa. World Health Organization (WHO) named this mutant as a variant of concern - Omicron (B.1.1.529) on 26th November 2021. This variant exhibited more than thirty amino acid mutations in the spike protein. This mutation rate is exceeding the other variants by approximately 5-11 times in the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein. Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant might have enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. This new variant can reinfect individuals previously infected with other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Scientists expressed their concern about the efficacy of already existing COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron (B.1.1.529) infections. Some of the crucial mutations that are detected in the receptor-binding domain of the Omicron variant have been shared by previously evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on the Omicron mutation profile in the receptor-binding domain and motif, it might have collectively enhanced or intermediary infectivity relative to its previous variants. Due to extensive mutations in the spike protein, the Omicron variant might evade the immunity in the vaccinated individuals.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.529
180	10.2807/1560-7917.es.2021.26.45.2100974	The SARS-CoV-2 Lambda (Pango lineage designation C.37) variant of interest, initially identified in Peru, has spread to additional countries. First detected in Israel in April 2021 following importations from Argentina and several European countries, the Lambda variant infected 18 individuals belonging to two main transmission chains without further spread. Micro-neutralisation assays following Comirnaty (BNT162b2 mRNA, BioNTech-Pfizer) vaccination demonstrated a significant 1.6-fold reduction in neutralising titres compared with the wild type virus, suggesting increased susceptibility of vaccinated individuals to infection.	mutation_name_list: C.37
181	10.2807/1560-7917.es.2022.27.10.2100815	BACKGROUND: The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 had become predominant globally by November 2021. AIM: We evaluated transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the Delta variant in an outbreak in southern China. METHODS: Data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts were retrospectively collected from the outbreak that occurred in Guangdong, China in May and June 2021. Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. RESULTS: We identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. Mean estimates of latent and incubation period were 3.9 days and 5.8 days, respectively. Relatively higher viral load was observed in infections with Delta than in infections with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Secondary attack rate among close contacts of cases with Delta was 1.4%, and 73.1% (95% credible interval (CrI): 32.9–91.4) of the transmissions occurred before onset. Index cases without vaccination (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.84; 95% CI: 1.19–8.45) or with an incomplete vaccination series (aOR: 6.02; 95% CI: 2.45–18.16) were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received the complete primary vaccination series. DISCUSSION: Patients infected with the Delta variant had more rapid symptom onset compared with the wild type. The time-varying serial interval should be accounted for in estimation of reproduction numbers. The higher viral load and higher risk of pre-symptomatic transmission indicated the challenges in control of infections with the Delta variant.	mutation_name_list: DELTA

We report a case cluster caused by Delta sublineage B.1.617.2 harboring the mutation E484K in Italy during July 11–July 29, 2021.

183	10.33263/briac125.68956914	COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 that belongs to the Corona groups. The subgroups of the coronavirus families are α, β, γ, and δ coronavirus. On June 15, 2021, the string λ of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated as a variant of interest via the World Health Organization. This string has a high prevalence in some parts of South American countries, but it occurred only occasionally in Brazil. This study confirms that mutations in the λ-spike protein can be destroyed the neutralizing antibodies and increase infectivity. Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 have an evolutionary superpower called “recombination” which permits the mixing of their genomes into novel combinations. Unlike regular mutation, which precedes slowly one change at a time, recombination can produce whole changes in a coronavirus genome. Although right now, is a concern, a mixing of λ with other variants such as is much more of a concern compared to alone variants. There is another item: the recombination can arise within the sample after it was taken from the infected person, not while it was inside their body. © 2021 by the authors.	mutation_name_list: LAMBDA
184	10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e124	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has spread worldwide since it was first identified in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019. With the global transmission of the virus, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have also appeared, especially, emerging strains that have recently been discovered in the United Kingdom (variant 20I/501Y.V1, lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (variant 20H/501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351), and Brazil (variant 20 J/501Y.V3, and lineage P.1). The common feature of these variants is that they share the N501Y mutation involving the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which is precisely the target of most COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, mutations such as N501Y, E484K, and K417N in the S protein may affect viral fitness and transmissibility. However, current research on the impact of these variants on COVID-19 vaccines is still lacking. Herein, we briefly explain why most COVID-19 vaccines target the S protein, update the progress of research regarding S protein-related COVID-19 vaccines, review the latest studies concerning the effects of S protein variants on COVID-19 vaccines, and finally, propose certain strategies to deal with SARS-CoV-2 variants.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_E484K, SPIKE_K417N
185	10.33696/immunology.3.085	New globally circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains are causing concern about evolution of virus transmissibility, fitness and immune evasion mechanisms. A variant emerging from the United Kingdom called SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, or B.1.1.7, is thought to exhibit increased transmissibility that results from replication 4–10 times faster than the original Wuhan virus (Wuhan-Hu-1). Although this property is suspected to result from a specific mutation in the spike glycoprotein, D614G, there are 9 mutations that distinguish the UK variant B.1.1.7 from Wuhan-Hu-1 yet to be evaluated for functional effects. We asked if mutated positions fixed in UK variant B.1.1.7 may be involved in the virus life cycle, or evasion of the immune response, by modeling the UK variant spike protein and conducting structural analysis of mutations on the spike glycoprotein trimer (protomer) complexed to ACE2. Importantly, 4 out of 9 differences between the UK variant B.1.1.7 and Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein alter direct intermolecular interactions. N501Y increased affinity between the spike protein and ACE2. The mutations at A570D, D614G and S982A reduced contact between individual chains of the trimeric spike protomer, potentially enhancing cleavage into S1 and S2 subunits, dynamic structural rearrangement and host cell fusion mechanisms. These data suggest that combined characteristics of mutations unique to UK variant B.1.1.7 enable high affinity binding to ACE2 and enhanced replication properties. The D614G mutation, associated with enhanced virus transmissibility, opens a potentially druggable structural pocket at the interface between spike glycoprotein subunits S1 and S2.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_A570D, SPIKE_D614G, SPIKE_S982A
186	10.3389/fcell.2021.697035	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been undergoing various mutations. The analysis of the structural and energetic effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will be beneficial for epidemic surveillance, diagnosis, and optimization of neutralizing agents. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, a key mutation N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region created a new salt bridge with Glu329 of hACE2, which resulted in greater electrostatic complementarity, and created a weak salt bridge with Asp442 of RBD. Furthermore, the N439K-mutated RBD bound hACE2 with a higher affinity than wild-type, which may lead to more infectious. In addition, the N439K-mutated RBD was markedly resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody REGN10987, which may lead to the failure of neutralization. The results show consistent with the previous experimental conclusion and clarify the structural mechanism under affinity changes. Our methods will offer guidance on the assessment of the infection efficiency and antigenicity effect of continuing mutations in SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N439K
187	10.3389/fcimb.2021.753249	BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is evolving continuously with emergence of several variants of increasing transmission capabilities and pandemic potential. Generation of variants occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature of viral genome, which is further enhanced by variable selection pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without mild gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic symptoms. However, the virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation, infection in various organs, and host response to emerging variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation. Several studies have reported underlying diseases including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders, and immunocompromised conditions as significant risk factors for severe form of COVID-19. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are also highly predominant in the population, which can alter COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response. We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases. METHODS: In this review, we have elucidated the emergence and characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants, mechanisms of infection and host immune response, GI and hepatic manifestation with radiologic features of COVID-19, and outcomes in pre-existing liver and GI diseases. KEY FINDINGS: Emerging variants of concern (VOC) have shown increased transmissibility and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality. There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including alpha (B.1.1.7, UK), beta (B.1.351, South Africa), gamma (B.1.1.28.1, Brazil), and delta (B1.1.617, India) variants. The mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for increased receptor binding (N501Y, P681R) and immune escape (L452R, E484K/Q, T478K/R) to host response. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease TMPRSS2, which is required for both spike protein binding and cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of SARS-CoV2 are less severe, the detection of virus in patient’s stool indicates GI tropism, replication, and shedding from the GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury, acute hepatic decompensation, and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure may change the disease outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the spike protein of emerging variants, immunomodulation by viral proteins, and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_P681R, SPIKE_L452R, SPIKE_E484K, SPIKE_E484Q, SPIKE_T478K, SPIKE_T478R, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.1.28.1, B.1.1.617
188	10.3389/fimmu.2021.720205	Patients with the monogenic immune dysregulatory syndrome autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, uniformly carry neutralizing autoantibodies directed against type-I interferons (IFNs) and many develop autoimmune pneumonitis, both of which place them at high risk for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and block entry of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. The use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab early during infection was associated with reduced COVID-19–associated hospitalization and death in patients at high risk for progressing to severe disease, which led the US Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for their administration in non-hypoxemic, non-hospitalized high-risk patients. However, the safety and efficacy of these mAbs has not been evaluated in APECED patients. We enrolled two siblings with APECED on an IRB-approved protocol (NCT01386437) and admitted them prophylactically at the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We assessed the safety and clinical effects of early treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. The administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab was well tolerated and was associated with amelioration of COVID-19 symptoms and prevention of invasive ventilatory support, admission to the intensive care, and death in both patients without affecting the production of antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. If given early in the course of COVID-19 infection, bamlanivimab and etesevimab may be beneficial in APECED and other high-risk patients with neutralizing autoantibodies directed against type-I IFNs.	mutation_name_list: 
189	10.3389/fimmu.2021.751778	During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged and spread worldwide. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was first reported in India in October 2020 and was classified as a “variant of concern (VOC)” by the WHO on 11 May, 2021. Compared to the wild-type strain, several studies have shown that the Delta variant is more transmissible and has higher viral loads in infected samples. COVID-19 patients infected with the Delta variant have a higher risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. The Delta variant is becoming the dominant strain in many countries around the world. This review summarizes and analyses the biological characteristics of key amino acid mutations, the epidemic characteristics, and the immune escape of the Delta variant. We hope to provide scientific reference for the monitoring and prevention measures of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant and the development strategy of a second-generation vaccine.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2
190	10.3389/fimmu.2021.752003	The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have become a major concern in the containment of current pandemic. The variants, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) have shown reduced sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies, plasma and/or sera obtained from convalescent patients and vaccinated individuals. Development of potent therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with broad neutralizing breadth have become a priority for alleviating the devastating effects of this pandemic. Here, we review some of the most promising broadly neutralizing antibodies obtained from plasma of patients that recovered from early variants of SARS-CoV-2 that may be effective against emerging new variants of the virus. This review summarizes several mAbs, that have been discovered to cross-neutralize across Sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants. Understanding the characteristics that confer this broad and cross-neutralization functions of these mAbs would inform on the development of therapeutic antibodies and guide the discovery of second-generation vaccines.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.617.2
191	10.3389/fimmu.2021.757197	The recent identification and rise to dominance of the P.1 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants have brought international concern because they may confer fitness advantages. The same three positions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) are affected in both variants, but where the 417 substitution differs, the E484K/N501Y have co-evolved by convergent evolution. Here we characterize the functional and immune evasive consequences of the P.1 and B.1.351 RBD mutations. E484K and N501Y result in gain-of-function with two different outcomes: The N501Y confers a ten-fold affinity increase towards ACE-2, but a modest antibody evasion potential of plasma from convalescent or vaccinated individuals, whereas the E484K displays a significant antibody evasion capacity without a major impact on affinity. On the other hand, the two different 417 substitutions severely impair the RBD/ACE-2 affinity, but in the combined P.1 and B.1.351 RBD variants, this effect is partly counterbalanced by the effect of the E484K and N501Y. Our results suggest that the combination of these three mutations is a two-step forward and one step back in terms of viral fitness.	mutation_name_list: P.1, B.1.351, SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_E484K
192	10.3389/fimmu.2022.836232	The continuous emergence of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, especially the variants of concern (VOC), exacerbated the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the key of viral entry into host cells, the spike (S) protein is the major target of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies elicited by infection or vaccination. However, the mutations of S protein in variants may change the infectivity and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the immune escape from those neutralizing antibodies. To characterize the mutations of S protein in newly emerging variants, the proteolytic property and binding affinity with receptor were assessed, and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus system was used to assess the infectivity and immune escape. We found that some SARS-CoV-2 variants have changed significantly in viral infectivity; especially, B.1.617.2 is more likely to infect less susceptible cells than D614G, and the virus infection process can be completed in a shorter time. In addition, neutralizing mAbs and vaccinated sera partially or completely failed to inhibit host cell entry mediated by the S protein of certain SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, SARS-CoV-2 variant S protein-mediated viral infection can still be blocked by protease inhibitors and endocytosis inhibitors. This work provides a deeper understanding of the rise and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their immune evasion.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2
193	10.3389/fmolb.2021.614443	The emergence of novel coronavirus mutants is a main factor behind the deterioration of the epidemic situation. Further studies into the pathogenicity of these mutants are thus urgently needed. Binding of the spinous protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor was shown to initiate coronavirus entry into host cells and lead to their infection. The receptor-binding motif (RBM, 438–506) is a region that directly interacts with ACE2 receptor in the RBD and plays a crucial role in determining affinity. To unravel how mutations in the non-RBM regions impact the interaction between RBD and ACE2, we selected three non-RBM mutant systems (N354D, D364Y, and V367F) from the documented clinical cases, and the Q498A mutant system located in the RBM region served as the control. Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted on the mutant systems and the wild-type (WT) system, and verified experiments also performed. Non-RBM mutations have been shown not only to change conformation of the RBM region but also to significantly influence its hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In particular, the D364Y and V367F systems showed a higher affinity for ACE2 owing to their electrostatic interactions and polar solvation energy changes. In addition, although the binding free energy at this point increased after the mutation of N354D, the conformation of the random coil (Pro384-Asp389) was looser than that of other systems, and the combined effect weakened the binding free energy between RBD and ACE2. Interestingly, we also found a random coil (Ala475-Gly485). This random coil is very sensitive to mutations, and both types of mutations increase the binding free energy of residues in this region. We found that the binding loop (Tyr495-Tyr505) in the RBD domain strongly binds to Lys353, an important residue of the ACE2 domain previously identified. The binding free energy of the non-RBM mutant group at the binding loop had positive and negative changes, and these changes were more obvious than that of the Q498A system. The results of this study elucidate the effect of non-RBM mutation on ACE2-RBD binding, and provide new insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutation research.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D364Y, SPIKE_V367F, SPIKE_N354D
194	10.3389/fphar.2021.755600	Repurposing of currently available drugs is a valuable strategy to tackle the consequences of COVID-19. Recently, several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants. Several antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2. Several clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the B.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine, known as anesthetic at high doses, and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudoviruses with common receptor binding domain mutations, N501Y, K417N, and E484K, as well as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2. Our study confirms previous data and extends information on the repurposing of these drugs to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection including different variants of concern, however, extensive clinical studies must be performed to confirm our in vitro findings.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_K417N, SPIKE_E484K, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, P.1, B.1.2
195	10.3390/biom11070919	SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein is the target for the antiviral drug Remdesivir (RDV). With RDV clinical trials on COVID-19 patients showing a reduced hospitalisation time. During the spread of the virus, the RdRp has developed several mutations, with the most frequent being A97V and P323L. The current study sought to investigate whether A97V and P323L mutations influence the binding of RDV to the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 compared to wild-type (WT). The interaction of RDV with WT-, A97V-, and P323L-RdRp were measured using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and the free binding energies were extracted. Results showed that RDV that bound to WT- and A97V-RdRp had a similar dynamic motion and internal residue fluctuations, whereas RDV interaction with P323L-RdRp exhibited a tighter molecular conformation, with a high internal motion near the active site. This was further corroborated with RDV showing a higher binding affinity to P323L-RdRp (−24.1 kcal/mol) in comparison to WT-RdRp (−17.3 kcal/mol). This study provides insight into the potential significance of administering RDV to patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 P323L-RdRp mutation, which may have a more favourable chance of alleviating the SARS-CoV-2 illness in comparison to WT-RdRp carriers, thereby suggesting further scientific consensus for the usage of Remdesivir as clinical candidate against COVID-19.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_P323L, NSP12_A97V
196	10.3390/biom11091273	The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates the viral–host interaction and is a target for most neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations pose a threat due to their role in host cell entry via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor that might strengthen SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, viral load, or resistance against neutralizing antibodies. To understand the molecular structural link between RBD mutations and infectivity, the top five mutant RBDs (i.e., N501Y, E484K L452R, S477N, and N439K) were selected based on their recorded case numbers. These mutants along with wild-type (WT) RBD were studied through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 100 ns. The principal component analysis and the free energy landscape were used too. Interestingly, N501Y, N439K, and E484K mutations were observed to increase the rigidity in some RBD regions while increasing the flexibility of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region, suggesting a compensation of the entropy penalty. However, S477N and L452R RBDs were observed to increase the flexibility of the RBM region while maintaining similar flexibility in other RBD regions in comparison to WT RBD. Therefore, both mutations (especially S477N) might destabilize the RBD structure, as loose conformation compactness was observed. The destabilizing effect of S477N RBD was consistent with previous work on S477N mutation. Finally, the free energy landscape results showed that mutations changed WT RBD conformation while local minima were maintained for all mutant RBDs. In conclusion, RBD mutations definitely impact the WT RBD structure and conformation as well as increase the binding affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_N439K, SPIKE_E484K, SPIKE_S477N, SPIKE_L452R
197	10.3390/biom11101494	Among the more recently identified SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest (VOI) is the Lambda variant, which emerged in Peru and has rapidly spread to South American regions and the US. This variant remains poorly investigated, particularly regarding the effects of mutations on the thermodynamic parameters affecting the stability of the Spike protein and its Receptor Binding Domain. We report here an in silico study on the potential impact of the Spike protein mutations on the immuno-escape ability of the Lambda variant. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that a combination of shortening the immunogenic epitope loops and the generation of potential N-glycosylation sites may be a viable adaptation strategy, potentially allowing this emerging viral variant to escape from host immunity.	mutation_name_list: LAMBDA
198	10.3390/biomedicines9050525	The B.1.1.7 variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus shows enhanced infectiousness over the wild type virus, leading to increasing patient numbers in affected areas. Amino acid exchanges within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant of B.1.1.7 affect inter-monomeric contact sites within the trimer (A570D and D614G) as well as the ACE2-receptor interface region (N501Y), which comprises the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. However, the molecular consequences of mutations within B.1.1.7 on spike protein dynamics and stability or ACE2 binding are largely unknown. Here, molecular dynamics simulations comparing SARS-CoV-2 wild type with the B.1.1.7 variant revealed inter-trimeric contact rearrangements, altering the structural flexibility within the spike protein trimer. Furthermore, we found increased flexibility in direct spatial proximity of the fusion peptide due to salt bridge rearrangements induced by the D614G mutation in B.1.1.7. This study also implies a reduced binding affinity for B.1.1.7 with ACE2, as the N501Y mutation restructures the RBD–ACE2 interface, significantly decreasing the linear interaction energy between the RBD and ACE2. Our results demonstrate how mutations found within B.1.1.7 enlarge the flexibility around the fusion peptide and change the RBD–ACE2 interface. We anticipate our findings to be starting points for in depth biochemical and cell biological analyses of B.1.1.7.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, SPIKE_A570D, SPIKE_D614G, SPIKE_N501Y
199	10.3390/ijerph19031127	Few studies have assessed incubation periods of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Delta variant. This study aimed to elucidate the transmission dynamics, especially the incubation period, for the Delta variant compared with non-Delta strains. We studied unvaccinated coronavirus disease 2019 patients with definite single exposure date from August 2020 to September 2021 in Japan. The incubation periods were calculated and compared by Mann–Whitney U test for Delta (with L452R mutation) and non-Delta cases. We estimated mean and percentiles of incubation period by fitting parametric distribution to data in the Bayesian statistical framework. We enrolled 214 patients (121 Delta and 103 non-Delta cases) with one specific date of exposure to the virus. The mean incubation period was 3.7 days and 4.9 days for Delta and non-Delta cases, respectively (p-value = 0.000). When lognormal distributions were fitted, the estimated mean incubation periods were 3.7 (95% credible interval (CI) 3.4–4.0) and 5.0 (95% CI 4.5–5.6) days for Delta and non-Delta cases, respectively. The estimated 97.5th percentile of incubation period was 6.9 (95% CI 5.9–8.0) days and 10.4 (95% CI 8.6–12.7) days for Delta and non–Delta cases, respectively. Unvaccinated Delta variant cases had shorter incubation periods than non–Delta variant cases.	mutation_name_list: DELTA
200	10.3390/ijms22115464	The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Currently, most of the research efforts towards the development of vaccines and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were mainly focused on the spike (S) protein, which mediates virus entry into the host cell by binding to ACE2. As the virus SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, variants have emerged, characterized by multiple mutations of the S glycoprotein. Herein, we employed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of the mutations of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 (B.1.1.7), termed the “UK variant”, in comparison with the wild type, with the aim to decipher the structural basis of the reported increased infectivity and virulence. The simulations provided insights on the different dynamics of UK and wild-type S glycoprotein, regarding in particular the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). In addition, we investigated the role of glycans in modulating the conformational transitions of the RBD. The overall results showed that the UK mutant experiences higher flexibility in the RBD with respect to wild type; this behavior might be correlated with the increased transmission reported for this variant. Our work also adds useful structural information on antigenic “hotspots” and epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
201	10.3390/ijms22179131	The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in December 2019 has caused a global pandemic. The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, B.1.617.3, SPIKE_N501Y, SPIKE_L452R, SPIKE_E484Q, SPIKE_T478K
202	10.3390/ijms221910836	Coronavirus disease 19, or COVID-19, is an infection associated with an unprecedented worldwide pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has led to more than 215 million infected people and more than 4.5 million deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 cell infection is initiated by a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein, a fusion protein, binding human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), that acts as the functional receptor through the receptor binding domain (RBD). In this article, the interaction of hACE2 with the RBD and how fusion is initiated after recognition are explored, as well as how mutations influence infectivity and immune response. Thus, we focused on all structures available in the Protein Data Bank for the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and hACE2. Specifically, the Delta variant carries particular mutations associated with increased viral fitness through decreased antibody binding, increased RBD affinity and altered protein dynamics. Combining both existing mutations and mutagenesis studies, new potential SARS-CoV-2 variants, harboring advantageous S protein mutations, may be predicted. These include mutations S13I and W152C, decreasing antibody binding, N460K, increasing RDB affinity, or Q498R, positively affecting both properties.	mutation_name_list: DELTA, SPIKE_N460K, SPIKE_Q498R, SPIKE_S13I, SPIKE_W152C
203	10.3390/life11111259	SARS-CoV-2 isolates from long-term COVID-19 patients play a significant role in understanding the mechanisms of infection and virus persistence. This study describes a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from a 53-year-old woman from Apulia (Italy), who was COVID-19 positive for approximately four months. In this paper we aimed to investigate any potential correlation between genetic mutations and clinical features of this case of infection. The viral isolate was assigned to lineage B.1.177.51 through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and harbored a novel set of mutations on the Spike protein (V143D, del144/145 and E484K); furthermore, seroneutralization assays showed impaired response of the surveyed strain to BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine-induced (average reduction of 70%) and convalescent sera (average reduction of 19.04%), when compared to VOC P.1. This study highlights the importance of genomic surveillance for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevance of monitoring of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations in all lineages, and the necessity of testing the response of emerging variants to available therapies and vaccines.	mutation_name_list: B.1.177.51
204	10.3390/microorganisms9112331	Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) might be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to bind and enter the host cell. Recently reported mutations in the spike glycoprotein unique to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different variants might increase the binding and pathogenesis. However, it is still not known how these mutations affect the binding of RBD to GRP78. The current study provides a structural basis for the binding of GRP78 to the different variants, i.e., B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 (spike RBD), of SARS-CoV-2 using a biomolecular simulation approach. Docking results showed that the new variants bound stronger than the wild-type, which was further confirmed through the free energy calculation results. All-atom simulation confirmed structural stability, which was consistent with previous results by following the global stability trend. We concluded that the increased binding affinity of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants was due to a variation in the bonding network that helped the virus induce a higher infectivity and disease severity. Consequently, we reported that the aforementioned new variants use GRP78 as an alternate receptor to enhance their seriousness.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1
205	10.3390/pathogens10020184	In December 2019, the first cases of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were identified in the city of Wuhan, China. Since then, it has spread worldwide with new mutations being reported. The aim of the present study was to monitor the changes in genetic diversity and track non-synonymous substitutions (dN) that could be implicated in the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 and its spread in different regions between December 2019 and November 2020. We analyzed 2213 complete genomes from six geographical regions worldwide, which were downloaded from GenBank and GISAID databases. Although SARS-CoV-2 presented low genetic diversity, there has been an increase over time, with the presence of several hotspot mutations throughout its genome. We identified seven frequent mutations that resulted in dN substitutions. Two of them, C14408T>P323L and A23403G>D614G, located in the nsp12 and Spike protein, respectively, emerged early in the pandemic and showed a considerable increase in frequency over time. Two other mutations, A1163T>I120F in nsp2 and G22992A>S477N in the Spike protein, emerged recently and have spread in Oceania and Europe. There were associations of P323L, D614G, R203K and G204R substitutions with disease severity. Continuous molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 will be necessary to detect and describe the transmission dynamics of new variants of the virus with clinical relevance. This information is important to improve programs to control the virus.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_P323L, SPIKE_D614G, N_R203K, N_G204R
206	10.3390/pathogens10121586	The emergence of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) has been a global concern. The B.1.1.7 variant of SARS CoV-2 is reported to cause higher transmission. The study investigates the replication cycle and transcriptional pattern of the B.1.1.7 to hypothesis the possible role of different genes in viral replication. It was observed that the B.1.1.7 variant required a longer maturation time. The transcriptional response demonstrated higher expression of ORF6 and ORF8 compared to nucleocapsid transcript till the eclipse period which might influence higher viral replication. The number of infectious viruses titer is higher in the B.1.1.7, despite a lesser copy number than B.1, indicating higher transmissibility. The experimental evidence published linked ORF6 and ORF8 to play important role in replication and we also observed their higher expression. This leads us to hypothesis the possible role of ORF6 and ORF8 in B.1.1.7 higher replication which causes higher transmission.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
207	10.3390/v13050883	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, as observed with the D614G spike protein mutant and, more recently, with B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) and B.1.1.28.1 (P.1) lineages, represent a continuous threat and might lead to strains of higher infectivity and/or virulence. We report on the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 haplotype with nine mutations including D614G/T307I double-mutation of the spike. This variant expanded and completely replaced previous lineages within a short period in the subantarctic Magallanes Region, southern Chile. The rapid lineage shift was accompanied by a significant increase of cases, resulting in one of the highest incidence rates worldwide. Comparative coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations indicated that T307I and D614G belong to a previously unrecognized dynamic domain, interfering with the mobility of the receptor binding domain of the spike. The T307I mutation showed a synergistic effect with the D614G. Continuous surveillance of new mutations and molecular analyses of such variations are important tools to understand the molecular mechanisms defining infectivity and virulence of current and future SARS-CoV-2 strains.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1
208	10.3390/v13081514	SARS-CoV-2 spike is evolving to maximize transmissibility and evade the humoral response. The massive genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates has led to the identification of single-point mutations and deletions, often having the recurrence of hotspots, associated with advantageous phenotypes.

209	10.3390/v13122485	The SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617 lineage variants, Kappa (B.1.617.1) and Delta (B.1.617.2, AY) emerged during the second wave of infections in India, but the Delta variants have become dominant worldwide and continue to evolve. Here, we compared B.1.617 variants for neutralization resistance by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 pseudoviruses showed a modest 1.5- to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 pseudoviruses, but 7- and 16-fold reductions for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, were seen for B.1.351 pseudoviruses. Among twenty-three therapeutic antibodies tested, four antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses and six antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 and AY.1 pseudoviruses. Our results indicate that the current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants. Finally, the P681R substitution confers efficient cleavage of B.1.617 variants’ spike proteins and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, AY.1, C.37, P.1, R.1, B.1.526, B.1.351, B.1.617.1.

210	10.3390/v14020172	The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten healthcare systems worldwide due to the limited access to vaccines, suboptimal treatment options, and the continuous emergence of new and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Reverse-genetics studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes, green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated substitutions F480L and V570L—and naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and N491S, all in nsp12—did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient non-infectious subgenomic replicon system. The developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse-genetics systems, including recombinants to modify infectious viruses and non-infectious subgenomic replicons with autonomous genomic RNA replication, will permit high-throughput cell culture studies—providing fundamental understanding of basic biology of this coronavirus. We have proven the utility of the systems in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19. Our system provides a platform to effectively test the antiviral activity of drugs and the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_F480L, NSP12_V570L, NSP12_A97V, NSP12_P323L, NSP12_N491S
211	10.3390/v14020323	Studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load (VL) according to virus variant and host vaccination status have yielded inconsistent results. We conducted a single center prospective study between July and September 2021 at the drive-through testing center of the Toulouse University Hospital. We compared the NP VL of 3775 patients infected by the Delta (n = 3637) and Alpha (n = 138) variants, respectively. Patient’s symptoms and vaccination status (2619 unvaccinated, 636 one dose and 520 two doses) were recorded. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing and variant screening were assessed by using Thermo Fisher(®) TaqPath™ COVID-19 and ID solutions(®) ID™ SARS-CoV-2/VOC evolution Pentaplex assays. Delta SARS-CoV-2 infections were associated with higher VL than Alpha (coef = 0.68; p ≤ 0.01) independently of patient’s vaccination status, symptoms, age and sex. This difference was higher for patients diagnosed late after symptom onset (coef = 0.88; p = 0.01) than for those diagnosed early (coef = 0.43; p = 0.03). Infections in vaccinated patients were associated with lower VL (coef = −0.18; p ≤ 0.01) independently of virus variant, symptom, age and sex. Our results suggest that Delta infections could lead to higher VL and for a longer period compared to Alpha infections. By effectively reducing the NP VL, vaccination could allow for limiting viral spread, even with the Delta variant.	mutation_name_list: DELTA, ALPHA
212	10.3390/v14030545	Omicron is the most mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant—a factor that can affect transmissibility, disease severity, and immune evasiveness. Its genomic surveillance is important in cities with millions of inhabitants and an economic center, such as Mexico City. Results. From 16 November to 31 December 2021, we observed an increase of 88% in Omicron prevalence in Mexico City. We explored the R346K substitution, prevalent in 42% of Omicron variants, known to be associated with immune escape by monoclonal antibodies. In a phylogenetic analysis, we found several independent exchanges between Mexico and the world, and there was an event followed by local transmission that gave rise to most of the Omicron diversity in Mexico City. A haplotype analysis revealed that there was no association between haplotype and vaccination status. Among the 66% of patients who have been vaccinated, no reported comorbidities were associated with Omicron; the presence of odynophagia and the absence of dysgeusia were significant predictor symptoms for Omicron, and the RT-qPCR Ct values were lower for Omicron. Conclusions. Genomic surveillance is key to detecting the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a timely manner, even weeks before the onset of an infection wave, and can inform public health decisions and detect the spread of any mutation that may affect therapeutic efficacy.	mutation_name_list: OMICRON, SPIKE_R346K
213	10.3390/v14030650	There is a growing interest in using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the early stages of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to prevent disease progression. Little is known about the efficacy of mAbs against the delta variant of concern and its clinical presentations. We evaluated the effect of casirivimab/imdevimab treatment among five delta vaccine breakthrough patients. Symptomatic non-hospitalized vaccinated patients were submitted to nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Blood analysis and chest Computed Tomography were also performed. A cocktail of casirivimab/imdevimab was administrated, and patients were monitored weekly. Clinical evolution was evaluated by the regression of the symptoms, negative results by real-time RT-PCR, and by the need of hospitalization: these aspects were considered as significant outcomes. In four cases, symptom reversion and viral load reduction were observed within 2 days and 7 days after mAbs treatment, respectively. Only one case, suffering from thymoma, was hospitalized 2 days later because of respiratory failure, which reverted within 18 days. mAbs treatment seems to be safe and effective against the delta variant and its clinical manifestations.	mutation_name_list: DELTA

215	10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20211118-00899	Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 epidemic in Ejina banner, Inner Mongolia, in October 2021 and provide evidence for the improvement of COVID-19 prevention and control. Methods: The information about the time, area and population distributions of COVID-19 cases in Ejina before November 13, 2021 and the gene sequencing result of the isolates were collected for a statistical descriptive analysis. Results: The first COVID-19 case in Ejina occurred on 7 October, 2021. A total of 164 COVID-19 cases were reported from October 19 to November 12. Most cases were distributed in 6 communities in Darahub (156 cases, 95.12%). The result of full gene sequencing of the isolates indicted that the pathogen was Delta variant (B.1.617.2). The male to female ratio of the cases was 1.3â¶1. The age of cases ranged from 1 to 85 years, and the cases aged 20-59 years accounted for 78.66%. The main clinical symptoms were sore throat (91 cases, 91.92%), cough (49 cases, 49.49%) and fever (23 cases, 23.23%). Most cases were ordinary ones (81 cases, 49.39%) and mild ones (68 cases, 41.46%). The cases were mainly detected at the isolation points (84 cases, 51.22%) and through population based nucleic acid testing (62 cases, 37.80%). The basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was 5.3, the average incubation period was 3.9 days. The local government rapidly started â £ level emergency response and conducted 10 rounds of nucleic acid tests. The transferring of travelers reduced the risk for the further spread of COVID-19 in Ejina. Conclusions: The epidemic of COVID-19 in Ejina characterized by strong transmission, short incubation period, herd susceptibility and case clustering. Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was the pathogen, which might be imported from Zeke port. Comprehensive prevention and control measures, such as closed-loop management and vaccination, should be continued. The successful transferring of the patients and travelers provided evidence for the effective and precise prevention and control of COVID-19 in a routine manner.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2
216	10.4414/smw.2022.w30133	BACKGROUND Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an important route of infection. For the wildtype (WT) only a small proportion of those infected emitted large quantities of the virus. The currently prevalent variants of concern, Delta (B1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529), are characterized by higher viral loads and a lower minimal infective dose compared to the WT. We aimed to describe the resulting distribution of airborne viral emissions and to reassess the risk estimates for public settings given the higher viral load and infectivity. METHOD We reran the Monte Carlo modelling to estimate viral emissions in the fine aerosol size range using available viral load data. We also updated our tool to simulate indoor airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by including a CO2 calculator and recirculating air cleaning devices. We also assessed the consequences of the lower critical dose on the infection risk in public settings with different protection strategies. RESULTS Our modelling suggests that a much larger proportion of individuals infected with the new variants are high, very high or super-emitters of airborne viruses: for the WT, one in 1,000 infected was a super-emitter; for Delta one in 30; and for Omicron one in 20 or one in 10, depending on the viral load estimate used. Testing of the effectiveness of protective strategies in view of the lower critical dose suggests that surgical masks are no longer sufficient in most public settings, while correctly fitted FFP2 respirators still provide sufficient protection, except in high aerosol producing situations such as singing or shouting. DISCUSSION From an aerosol transmission perspective, the shift towards a larger proportion of very high emitting individuals, together with the strongly reduced critical dose, seem to be two important drivers of the aerosol risk, and are likely contributing to the observed rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern. Reducing contacts, always wearing well-fitted FFP2 respirators when indoors, using ventilation and other methods to reduce airborne virus concentrations, and avoiding situations with loud voices seem critical to limiting these latest waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2, B.1.1.529
217	10.7150/ijbs.68973	Vaccines are proving to be highly effective in controlling hospitalization and deaths associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as shown by clinical trials and real-world evidence. However, a deadly second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infected by SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, with an increased number of post-vaccination breakthrough infections were reported in the world recently. Actually, Delta variant not only resulted in a severe surge of vaccine breakthrough infections which was accompanied with high viral load and transmissibility, but also challenged the development of effective vaccines. Therefore, the biological characteristics and epidemiological profile of Delta variant, the current status of Delta variant vaccine breakthrough infections and the mechanism of vaccine breakthrough infections were discussed in this article. In addition, the significant role of the Delta variant spike (S) protein in the mechanism of immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 was highlighted in this article. In particular, we further discussed key points on the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research and development, hoping to make a contribution to the early, accurate and rapid control of the COVID-19 epidemic.	mutation_name_list: B.1.617.2
218	10.7326/m22-0308	BACKGROUND: At the end of 2021, the B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 variant (Omicron) wave superseded the B.1.617.2 variant (Delta) wave. OBJECTIVE: To compare baseline characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Delta variant versus the Omicron variant in the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: Retrospective chart reviews. SETTING: 13 adult EDs in academic hospitals in the Paris area from 29 November 2021 to 10 January 2022. PATIENTS: Patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2 and variant identification. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome measures were baseline clinical and biological characteristics at ED presentation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3728 patients had a positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period; 1716 patients who had a variant determination (818 Delta and 898 Omicron) were included. Median age was 58 years, and 49% were women. Patients infected with the Omicron variant were younger (54 vs. 62 years; difference, 8.0 years [95% CI, 4.6 to 11.4 years]), had a lower rate of obesity (8.0% vs. 12.5%; difference, 4.5 percentage points [CI, 1.5 to 7.5 percentage points]), were more vaccinated (65% vs. 39% for 1 dose and 22% vs. 11% for 3 doses), had a lower rate of dyspnea (26% vs. 50%; difference, 23.6 percentage points [CI, 19.0 to 28.2 percentage points]), and had a higher rate of discharge home from the ED (59% vs. 37%; difference, 21.9 percentage points [−26.5 to −17.1 percentage points]). Compared with Delta, Omicron infection was independently associated with a lower risk for ICU admission (adjusted difference, 11.4 percentage points [CI, 8.4 to 14.4 percentage points]), mechanical ventilation (adjusted difference, 3.6 percentage points [CI, 1.7 to 5.6 percentage points]), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted difference, 4.2 percentage points [CI, 2.0 to 6.5 percentage points]). LIMITATION: Patients with COVID-19 illness and no SARS-CoV-2 variant determination in the ED were excluded. CONCLUSION: Compared with the Delta variant, infection with the Omicron variant in patients in the ED had different clinical and biological patterns and was associated with better in-hospital outcomes, including higher survival.

0	10.1002/1873-3468.14076	Recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) variants (B.1.1.7 and B.1351) have emerged harbouring mutations that make them highly contagious. The N501Y mutation within the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of these SARS‐CoV‐2 variants may enhance binding to the human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). However, no molecular explanation for such an enhanced affinity has so far been provided. Here, using all‐atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show that Y501 in the mutated RBD can be well‐coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, which may increase the overall binding affinity of the RBD for hACE2 by approximately 0.81 kcal·mol(−1). The binding dynamics revealed in our study may provide a working model to facilitate the design of more effective antibodies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: infectivity

3	10.1002/advs.202105378	The SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta (B.1.617.2) strain is a variant of concern (VOC) that has become the dominant strain worldwide in 2021. Its transmission capacity is approximately twice that of the original strain, with a shorter incubation period and higher viral load during infection. Importantly, the breakthrough infections of the Delta variant have continued to emerge in the first‐generation vaccine recipients. There is thus an urgent need to develop a novel vaccine with SARS‐CoV‐2 variants as the major target. Here, receptor binding domain (RBD)‐conjugated nanoparticle vaccines targeting the Delta variant, as well as the early and Beta/Gamma strains, are developed. Under both a single‐dose and a prime‐boost strategy, these RBD‐conjugated nanoparticle vaccines induce the abundant neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and significantly protect hACE2 mice from infection by the authentic SARS‐CoV‐2 Delta strain, as well as the early and Beta strains. Furthermore, the elicitation of the robust production of broader cross‐protective NAbs against almost all the notable SARS‐CoV‐2 variants including the Omicron variant in rhesus macaques by the third re‐boost with trivalent vaccines is found. These results suggest that RBD‐based monovalent or multivalent nanoparticle vaccines provide a promising second‐generation vaccine strategy for SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect_list: viral_transmission, viral_incubation_period, viral_load, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines

Novel variations that are unique to the receptor‐binding motif (RBM) of the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) spike glycoprotein, i. e. L452R‐E484Q, may play a different role in the B.1.617 (also known as G/452R.V3) variant's pathogenicity and better survival compared to the wild type. Therefore, a thorough analysis is needed to understand the impact of these mutations on binding with host receptor (RBD) and to guide new therapeutics development. In this study, we used structural and biomolecular simulation techniques to explore the impact of specific mutations (L452R‐E484Q) in the B.1.617 variant on the binding of RBD to the host receptor ACE2. Our analysis revealed that the B.1.617 variant possesses different dynamic behaviours by altering dynamic‐stability, residual flexibility and structural compactness. Moreover, the new variant had altered the bonding network and structural‐dynamics properties significantly. MM/GBSA technique was used, which further established the binding differences between the wild type and B.1.617 variant. In conclusion, this study provides a strong impetus to develop novel drugs against the new SARS‐CoV‐2 variants.	mutation_name: B.1.617 | effect_list: viral_fitness, protein_stability, protein_flexibility, protein_conformational_optimization, intermolecular_interactions

14	10.1002/jmv.20707	SARS‐CoV is a newly identified coronavirus (CoV) that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important structural and functional protein. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the SARS‐CoV N protein and to elucidate the possible involvement of N protein in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis, a human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two‐hybrid system assay. hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of sumoylation system, was found to interact specifically with the N protein, implying the post‐translational sumoylation of the N protein. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170–210, which includes the SR‐rich motif. However, the consensus motif of sumoylation GK(62)EE in the N protein is not responsible for binding to hUbc9. Mutations of hUbc9 at the enzyme active site C93A or C93S severely impair the interaction with the N protein. The two proteins were also shown to colocalize in the cytoplasm of the transfected 293T cells. This is the first report demonstrating the interaction of hUbc9 with a structural protein of plus‐strand RNA viruses, indicating a new drug target for SARS‐CoV. J. Med.

The long, complex orf1ab polyproteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 play an important role in viral RNA synthesis. To assess the impact of mutations in this important domain, we analyzed 1134 complete protein sequences of orf1ab polyprotein from NCBI Virus database from affected patients across various states of USA from December 2019 to 25(th) April 2020. Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega followed by statistical significance was calculated. Four significant mutations T265I (nsp 2), P4715L (nsp 12) and P5828L and Y5865C (both at nsp 13) were identified in important non‐structural proteins, which function either as replicase or helicase. A comparative analysis shows 265T→I, 5828P→L and 5865Y→C are unique to USA and not reported from Europe or Asia; while one, 4715P→L is predominant in both Europe and USA.

20	10.1002/jmv.27524	As the latest identified novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant of concern (VOC), the influence of Omicron on our globe grows promptly. Compared with the last VOC (Delta variant), more mutations were identified, which may address the characteristics of Omicron. Considering these crucial mutations and their implications including an increase in transmissibility, COVID-19 severity, and reduction of efficacy of currently available diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics, Omicron has been classified as one of the VOC. Notably, 15 of these mutations reside in the receptor-binding domain of spike glycoprotein, which may alter transmissibility, infectivity, neutralizing antibody escape, and vaccine breakthrough cases of COVID-19. Therefore, our present study characterizes the mutational hotspots of the Omicron variant in comparison with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, detailed information was analyzed to characterize the global perspective of Omicron, including transmission dynamic, effect on testing, and immunity, which shall promote the progress of the clinical application and basic research. Collectively, our data suggest that due to continuous variation in the spike glycoprotein sequences, the use of coronavirus-specific attachment inhibitors may not be the current choice of therapy for emerging SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Hence, we need to proceed with a sense of urgency in this matter.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: viral_transmission, disease_severity, effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs
21	10.1002/jmv.27526	Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially those of concern, may have an impact on the virus's transmissibility and pathogenicity, as well as diagnostic equipment performance and vaccine effectiveness. Even though the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) emerged during India's second wave of infections, Delta variants have grown dominant internationally and are still evolving. On November 26, 2021, WHO identified the variant B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern, naming it Omicron, based on evidence that Omicron contains numerous mutations that may influence its behaviour. However, the mode of transmission and severity of the Omicron variant remains unknown. We used computational studies to examine the Delta and Omicron variants in this work and found that the Omicron variant had a higher affinity for human ACE2 than the Delta variant due to a significant number of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, indicating a higher potential for transmission. Based on docking studies, the Q493R, N501Y, S371L, S373P, S375F, Q498R, and T478K mutations contribute significantly to high binding affinity with human ACE2. In comparison to the Delta variant, both the entire spike protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in Omicron include a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine. These amino acids are located within the protein's core and are required for structural stability. We observed a disorder-order transition in the Omicron variant between spike protein RBD regions 468-473, and it may be significant in the influence of disordered residues/regions on spike protein stability and binding to ACE2.

22	10.1002/jmv.27526	Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially those of concern, may have an impact on the virus's transmissibility and pathogenicity, as well as diagnostic equipment performance and vaccine effectiveness. Even though the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) emerged during India's second wave of infections, Delta variants have grown dominant internationally and are still evolving. On November 26, 2021, WHO identified the variant B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern, naming it Omicron, based on evidence that Omicron contains numerous mutations that may influence its behaviour. However, the mode of transmission and severity of the Omicron variant remains unknown. We used computational studies to examine the Delta and Omicron variants in this work and found that the Omicron variant had a higher affinity for human ACE2 than the Delta variant due to a significant number of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, indicating a higher potential for transmission. Based on docking studies, the Q493R, N501Y, S371L, S373P, S375F, Q498R, and T478K mutations contribute significantly to high binding affinity with human ACE2.

23	10.1002/jmv.27663	The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a threatening impact on a global scale, largely due to the emergence of newly SARS-CoV-2 variants. The Mu (PANGO lineage B.1.621), was first identified in Colombia in January 2021 and was classified as a variant of interest (VOI) in August 2021, due to a constellation of mutations that likely-mediate an unexpectedly enhanced immune resistance to inactivated vaccine-elicited antibodies. Despite if recently studies suggested that the Mu variant appear to have a less infectivity than the Delta variant, here we examined the structural effect of the Mu spike protein mutations and predicted the potential impact on infectivity of the Mu variant compared with the Delta and Delta plus spike protein.

24	10.1002/mco2.95	Several SARS‐CoV‐2 variants have emerged since the pandemic, bringing about a renewed threat to the public. Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was first detected in October 2020 in India and was characterized as variants of concern (VOC) by WHO on May 11, 2021. Delta variant rapidly outcompeted other variants to become the dominant circulating lineages due to its clear competitive advantage. There is emerging evidence of enhanced transmissibility and reduced vaccine effectiveness (VE) against Delta variant. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the features and phenotypic effects of this variant. Herein, we comprehensively described the evaluation and features of Delta variant, summarized the effects of mutations in spike on the infectivity, transmission ability, immune evasion, and provided a perspective on efficient approaches for preventing and overcoming COVID‐19.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect_list: viral_fitness, viral_transmission, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines
25	10.1002/prot.26042	The human spike protein sequences from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, and Oceania were analyzed by comparing with the reference severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) protein sequence from Wuhan‐Hu‐1, China. Out of 10333 spike protein sequences analyzed, 8155 proteins comprised one or more mutations. A total of 9654 mutations were observed that correspond to 400 distinct mutation sites. The receptor binding domain (RBD) which is involved in the interactions with human angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐2 (ACE‐2) receptor and causes infection leading to the COVID‐19 disease comprised 44 mutations that included residues within 3.2 Å interacting distance from the ACE‐2 receptor. The mutations observed in the spike proteins are discussed in the context of their distribution according to the geographical locations, mutation sites, mutation types, distribution of the number of mutations at the mutation sites and mutations at the glycosylation sites. The density of mutations in different regions of the spike protein sequence and location of the mutations in protein three‐dimensional structure corresponding to the RBD are discussed. The mutations identified in the present work are important considerations for antibody, vaccine, and drug development.	mutation_name:  | effect_list:

34	10.1007/978-3-030-86582-5_1	COVID-19 is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. Although a number of new vaccines are available to combat this threat, a high prevalence of novel mutant viral variants is observed in all world regions affected by this infection. Among viral proteomes, the highly glycosylated spike protein (Sprot) of SARS-CoV-2 has received the most attention due to its interaction with the host receptor ACE2. To understand the mechanisms of viral variant infectivity and the interaction of the RBD of Sprot with the host ACE2, we performed a large-scale mutagenesis study of the RBD-ACE2 interface by performing 1780 point mutations in silico and identifying the ambiguous stabilisation of the interface by the most common point mutations described in the literature. Furthermore, we pinpointed the N501Y mutation at the RBD of Sprot as profoundly affecting complex formation and confirmed greater stability of the N501Y mutant compared to wild-type (WT) viral S protein by molecular dynamics experiments. These findings could be important for the study and design of upcoming vaccines, PPI inhibitor molecules, and therapeutic antibodies or antibody mimics. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N501Y | effect_list: protein_stability
35	10.1007/s00253-021-11676-2	The progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has generated numerous emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 on a global scale. These variants have gained evolutionary advantages, comprising high virulence and serious infectivity due to multiple spike glycoprotein mutations. As a reason, variants are demonstrating significant abilities to escape the immune responses of the host. The D614G mutation in the S-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 variants has shown the most efficient interaction with the ACE2 receptor of the cells. This explicit mutation at amino acid position 614 (aspartic acid-to-glycine substitution) is the prime cause of infection and re-infection. It changes the conformation of RBD and cleavage patterns S-glycoprotein with higher stability, replication fitness, and fusion efficiencies. Therefore, this review aims to provide several crucial pieces of information associated with the D614 mutational occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their infectivity patterns. This review will also effectively emphasize the mechanism of action of D614G mutant variants, immune escape, and partial vaccine escape of this virus. Furthermore, the viral characteristic changes leading to the current global pandemic condition have been highlighted. Here, we have tried to illustrate a novel direction for future researchers to develop effective therapeutic approaches and counterweight strategies to minimize the spread of COVID-19. Key points • D614G mutation arises within the S-glycoprotein of significant SARS-CoV-2 variants. • The D614G mutation affects infection, re-infection, cleavage patterns of S-glycoprotein, and replication fitness of SARS-CoV-2 variants. • The D614G mutation influences the immunity and partial vaccine escape.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: binding_to_host_receptor, protein_stability, viral_fitness, risk_of_reinfection, protein_functioning, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, immune_escape

We report SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from 12,476 patients in the Houston Methodist healthcare system diagnosed from January 1 through May 31, 2021. Prevalence of the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant increased rapidly and caused 63%-90% of new cases in the latter half of May. Eleven B.1.1.7 genomes had an E484K replacement in spike protein, a change also identified in other SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Compared with non-B.1.1.7-infected patients, individuals with B.1.1.7 had a significantly lower cycle threshold (a proxy for higher virus load) and significantly higher hospitalization rate. Other variants (e.g., B.1.429 and B.1.427 (Epsilon), P.1 (Gamma), P.2 (Zeta), and R.1) also increased rapidly, although the magnitude was less than B.1.1.7. We identified 22 patients infected with B.1.617.1 (Kappa) or B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants; these patients had a high rate of hospitalization. Breakthrough cases (n=207) in fully vaccinated patients were caused by a heterogeneous array of virus genotypes, including many that are not currently designated variants of interest or concern. In the aggregate, our study delineates the trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in a major metropolitan area, documents B.1.1.7 as the major cause of new cases in Houston, and heralds the arrival of B.1.617 variants in the metroplex.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: ct_value, risk_of_hospitalization

39	10.1016/j.ajpath.2021.10.019	Genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 have repeatedly altered the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delta variants of concern are now the focus of intense international attention because they are causing widespread COVID-19 disease globally and are associated with vaccine breakthrough cases. We sequenced the genomes of 16,965 SARS-CoV-2 from samples acquired March 15, 2021 through September 20, 2021 in the Houston Methodist hospital system. This sample represents 91% of all Methodist system COVID-19 patients during the study period. Delta variants increased rapidly from late April onward to cause 99.9% of all COVID-19 cases and spread throughout the Houston metroplex. Compared to all other variants combined, Delta caused a significantly higher rate of vaccine breakthrough cases (23.7% for Delta compared to 6.6% for all other variants combined). Importantly, significantly fewer fully vaccinated individuals required hospitalization. Individuals with vaccine breakthrough cases caused by Delta had a low median PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value (a proxy for high virus load). This value was closely similar to the median Ct value for unvaccinated patients with COVID-19 caused by Delta variants, suggesting that fully vaccinated individuals can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to others. Patients infected with Alpha and Delta variants had several significant differences. Our integrated analysis emphasizes that vaccines used in the United States are highly effective in decreasing severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalizations, and deaths.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, ct_value

In the present in-silico study, 15,928 sequences of Orf3a reported worldwide were compared to identify variations in this protein. Our analysis revealed the occurrence of mutations at 173 residues of Orf3a protein. Subsequently, protein modelling was performed that revealed twelve mutations which can considerably affect the stability of Orf3a. Among the 12 mutations, three mutations (Y160H, D210Y and S171L) also lead to alterations in secondary structure and protein disorder parameters of the Orf3a protein. Further, we used predictive tools to identify five promising epitopes of B-cells, which resides in the mutated regions of Orf3a. Altogether, our study sheds light on the variations occurring in Orf3a that might contribute to alteration in protein structure and function.	mutation_name: ORF3A_D210Y | effect_list: protein_stability, protein_conformational_optimization

48	10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.033	SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 2M deaths in little over a year. Vaccines are being deployed at scale, aiming to generate responses against the virus spike. The scale of the pandemic and error-prone virus replication is leading to the appearance of mutant viruses and potentially escape from antibody responses. Variant B.1.1.7, now dominant in the UK, with increased transmission, harbours 9 amino-acid changes in the spike, including N501Y in the ACE2 interacting-surface. We examine the ability of B.1.1.7 to evade antibody responses elicited by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We map the impact of N501Y by structure/function analysis of a large panel of well-characterised monoclonal antibodies. B.1.1.7 is harder to neutralize than parental virus, compromising neutralization by some members of a major class of public antibodies through light chain contacts with residue 501. However, widespread escape from monoclonal antibodies or antibody responses generated by natural infection or vaccination was not observed.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission, sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera, sensitivity_to_antibodies
49	10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110394	The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) raises concerns about potential reduced sensitivity of the virus to antibody neutralization and subsequent vaccine breakthrough infections. Here, we use a live virus neutralization assay with sera from Pfizer- and Moderna-vaccinated individuals to examine neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 and observe a 3.9- and 2.7-fold reduction, respectively, in neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant compared with an early isolate bearing only a D614G substitution in its spike protein. We observe similar reduced sensitivity with sera from hamsters that were previously infected with an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Despite this reduction in neutralizing antibody titers against the Delta variant, hamsters previously infected (up to 15 months earlier) with an early isolate are protected from infection with the Delta variant, suggesting that the immune response to the first infection is sufficient to provide protection against subsequent infection with the Delta variant.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera, sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, risk_of_reinfection
50	10.1016/j.chom.2020.11.012	The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the pandemic that confers greater infectivity and is now the globally dominant form. To determine whether D614G might also mediate neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 spike. In all cases, the G614 pseudovirus was moderately more susceptible to neutralization. The G614 pseudovirus also was more susceptible to neutralization by receptor binding domain (RBD) monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera from people infected with either form of the virus. Negative stain electron microscopy revealed a higher percentage of the 1-RBD “up” conformation in the G614 spike, suggesting increased epitope exposure as a mechanism of enhanced vulnerability to neutralization. Based on these findings, the D614G mutation is not expected to be an obstacle for current vaccine development.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, infectivity, sensitivity_to_antibodies, sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera
51	10.1016/j.chom.2021.06.006	Many SARS-CoV-2 variants with naturally acquired mutations have emerged. These mutations can affect viral properties such as infectivity and immune resistance. Although the sensitivity of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 variants to humoral immunity has been investigated, sensitivity to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-restricted cellular immunity remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that two recently emerging mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, L452R (in B.1.427/429 and B.1.617) and Y453F (in B.1.1.298), confer escape from HLA-A24-restricted cellular immunity. These mutations reinforce affinity toward the host entry receptor ACE2. Notably, the L452R mutation increases spike stability, viral infectivity, viral fusogenicity, and thereby promotes viral replication. These data suggest that HLA-restricted cellular immunity potentially affects the evolution of viral phenotypes and that a further threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is escape from cellular immunity.	mutation_name: SPIKE_L452R | effect_list: immune_escape, binding_to_host_receptor, protein_stability, infectivity, viral_replication

53	10.1016/j.cmi.2021.05.022	BACKGROUND: Many new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been termed Variants of Concern/Interest (VOC/I) because of their greater risk due to possibly: enhanced transmissibility and/or severity, immune escape, diagnostic and/or treatment failure, and reduced vaccine efficacy. OBJECTIVES: We sought to review current knowledge of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, particularly those deemed VOC/Is: B.1.351, B.1.1.7, and P.1. SOURCES: MEDLINE and BioRxiv databases, as well as the grey literature were searched for reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants since November 2020. Relevant articles and their references were screened. CONTENT: Mutations on the spike protein in particular may affect both affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor ACEII or antibody binding. These VOC/Is often share similar mutation sets. The N501Y mutation is shared by the main three VOCs: B.1.1.7, first identified in the United Kingdom; P.1, originating from Brazil; and B.1.351, first described in South Africa. This mutation likely increases transmissibility, by increasing affinity for ACEII. The B.1.351 and P.1 variants also display the E484K mutation, which decreases binding of neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, favoring reinfections, and decreased in vitro efficacy of some antibody therapies or vaccines. Those mutations may also have phenotypical repercussions of higher severity. Furthermore, the accumulation of mutations poses a diagnostic risk (lowered when using multiplex assays), as seen for some assays targeting the S-gene. With ongoing surveillance, many new VOC/Is have been identified. The emergence of the E484K mutation independently in different parts of the globe may reflect adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans in a background of increasing immunity. IMPLICATIONS: These VOC/Is are increasing in frequency globally and pose challenges to any herd immunity approach of managing the pandemic. While vaccination is ongoing, vaccine updates may be prudent. The virus continues to adapt to transmission in humans, and further divergence from the initial Wuhan sequences is expected.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect_list: binding_to_antibodies, immune_escape, risk_of_reinfection, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs, disease_severity

55	10.1016/j.cmi.2021.05.025	OBJECTIVES: Detection and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is of eminent importance, particularly due to the rapid emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). In this study we evaluated if commercially available quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay can identify SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage samples by a specific N gene dropout or Ct value shift compared to the S or RdRp gene. METHODS: VOC B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2-positive patient samples were identified via whole-genome sequencing and variant-specific PCR. Confirmed B.1.1.7 (n=48) and non-B.1.1.7 samples (n=58) were analysed using the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV™ PCR assay for presence of SARS-CoV-2 S, RdRp and N gene. N gene coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with and without D3L mutation (specific for B.1.1.7) was cloned into pCR®-TOPO vectors to validate polymorphism dependent N gene dropout with Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV™ PCR assay. RESULTS: All studied B.1.1.7-positive patient samples showed significantly higher Ct values in qRT-PCR (Δ 6-10, N gene dropout on Ct values >29) of N gene compared to the corresponding values of S (p ≤ 0.0001) and RdRp (p ≤ 0.0001) genes. The assay reliably discriminated B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 positive samples (area under the curve AUC = 1) in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Identical Ct shifts (Δ 7-10) were detected in reverse genetic experiments, using isolated plasmids containing N gene coding sequences corresponding to D3 or 3L variants. CONCLUSIONS: A N gene dropout or Ct value shift is shown for B.1.1.7-positive samples in the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV PCR assay. This approach can be used as a rapid tool for B.1.1.7 detection in single assay high throughput diagnostics.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: ct_value, effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics
56	10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104936	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Reports of new variants that potentially increase virulence and viral transmission, as well as reduce the efficacy of available vaccines, have recently emerged. In this study, we computationally analyzed the N439K, S477 N, and T478K variants for their ability to bind Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used the protein-protein docking approach to explore whether the three variants displayed a higher binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor than the wild type. We found that these variants alter the hydrogen bonding network and the cluster of interactions. Additional salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and a high number of non-bonded contacts (i.e., non-bonded interactions between atoms in the same molecule and those in other molecules) were observed only in the mutant complexes, allowing efficient binding to the ACE2 receptor. Furthermore, we used a 2.0-μs all-atoms simulation approach to detect differences in the structural dynamic features of the resulting protein complexes. Our findings revealed that the mutant complexes possessed stable dynamics, consistent with the global trend of mutations yielding variants with improved stability and enhanced affinity. Binding energy calculations based on molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) further revealed that electrostatic interactions principally increased net binding energies. The stability and binding energies of N439K, S477 N, and T478K variants were enhanced compared to the wild-type-ACE2 complex. The net binding energy of the systems was −31.86 kcal/mol for the wild-type-ACE2 complex, −67.85 kcal/mol for N439K, −69.82 kcal/mol for S477 N, and −69.64 kcal/mol for T478K. The current study provides a basis for exploring the enhanced binding abilities and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 variants to design novel therapeutics against the virus.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N439K | effect_list: intermolecular_interactions, protein_stability, binding_to_host_receptor

Keeping in view the importance of the hot spot residue 501, we predicted the potentially emerging structural variants of 501 residue. We analyzed the binding pattern of wild type and mutants (Spike RBD) to the ACE2 receptor by deciphering variations in the amino acids’ interaction networks by graph kernels along with evolutionary, network metrics, and energetic information. Our analysis revealed that N501I, N501T, and N501V increase the binding affinity and alter the intra and inter-residue bonding networks. The N501T has shown strong positive selection and fitness in other animals.

62	10.1016/j.csbj.2022.01.017	The clinical manifestation of the recent pandemic COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, varies from mild to severe respiratory illness. Although environmental, demographic and co-morbidity factors have an impact on the severity of the disease, contribution of the mutations in each of the viral genes towards the degree of severity needs a deeper understanding for designing a better therapeutic approach against COVID-19. Open Reading Frame-3a (ORF3a) protein has been found to be mutated at several positions. In this work, we have studied the effect of one of the most frequently occurring mutants, D155Y of ORF3a protein, found in Indian COVID-19 patients. Using computational simulations we demonstrated that the substitution at 155th changed the amino acids involved in salt bridge formation, hydrogen-bond occupancy, interactome clusters, and the stability of the protein compared with the other substitutions found in Indian patients. Protein–protein docking using HADDOCK analysis revealed that substitution D155Y weakened the binding affinity of ORF3a with caveolin-1 compared with the other substitutions, suggesting its importance in the overall stability of ORF3a-caveolin-1 complex, which may modulate the virulence property of SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name: ORF3A_D155Y | effect_list: intermolecular_interactions, protein_stability, host_virus_interactions, viral_virulence

METHODS: : Suspected and non-suspected cases of VOC B.1.1.7 were defined according to the VirSNiP assay, which detects N501Y and deletion H69-V70. For pre-screening, the Allplex™ and TaqPath assays were used. RESULTS: : One hundred and sixteen suspected and 113 non-suspected cases were included. In the suspected cases, the Allplex assay showed N-gene dropout, or delayed Ct values of 6.27±1.21 and 6.66±1.41 compared with those of the RdRP and S-gene target, respectively. Agreement between the Allplex and TaqPath assays was 100% when the RdRP and S-gene targets had Ct values <35. Agreement between the Allplex and VirSNiP assays was 100% with Ct value <30. CONCLUSIONS: : The Allplex assay showed excellent agreement with the current pre-screening method for VOC B.1.1.7.

64	10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.103997	BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is rampantly spreading across the globe. We assessed the pathogenicity and immune response generated by BA.1.1 sub-lineage of SARS-CoV-2 [Omicron (R346K) variant] in 5 to 6-week old Syrian hamsters and compared the observations with that of Delta variant infection. METHODS: Virus shedding, organ viral load, lung disease and immune response generated in hamsters were sequentially assessed. FINDINGS: The disease characteristics of the Omicron (R346K) variant were found to be similar to that of the Delta variant infection in hamsters like viral replication in the respiratory tract and interstitial pneumonia. The Omicron (R346K) infected hamsters demonstrated lesser body weight reduction and viral RNA load in the throat swab and nasal wash samples in comparison to the Delta variant infection. The viral load in the lungs and nasal turbinate samples and the lung disease severity of the Omicron (R346K) infected hamsters were found comparable with that of the Delta variant infected hamsters. Neutralizing antibody response against Omicron (R346K) variant was detected from day 5 and the cross-neutralization titre of the sera against other variants showed severe reduction ie., 7 fold reduction against Alpha and no titers against B.1, Beta and Delta. INTERPRETATION: This preliminary data shows that Omicron (R346K) variant infection can produce moderate to severe lung disease similar to that of the Delta variant and the neutralizing antibodies produced in response to Omicron (R346K) variant infection shows poor neutralizing ability against other co-circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants like Delta which necessitates caution as it may lead to increased cases of reinfection. FUNDING: This study was supported by 10.13039/501100001411Indian Council of Medical Research as an intramural grant (COVID-19) to ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune.	mutation_name: BA.1.1 | effect_list: viral_replication, viral_load, viral_load, sensitivity_to_antibodies, disease_severity, risk_of_reinfection

We reported the epidemiological, viral, and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients infected with the Delta VOC during the local outbreak in Guangzhou, China. METHODS: We extracted the epidemiological and clinical information pertaining to the 159 cases infected with the Delta VOC across seven transmission generations between May 21 and June 18, 2021. The whole chain of the Delta VOC transmission was described. Kinetics of viral load and clinical characteristics were compared with a cohort of wild-type infection in 2020 admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. FINDINGS: There were four transmission generations within the first ten days. The Delta VOC yielded a significantly shorter incubation period (4.0 vs. 6.0 days), higher viral load (20.6 vs. 34.0, cycle threshold of the ORF1a/b gene), and a longer duration of viral shedding in pharyngeal swab samples (14.0 vs. 8.0 days) compared with the wild-type strain. In cases with critical illness, the proportion of patients over the age of 60 was higher in the Delta VOC group than in the wild-type strain (100.0% vs. 69.2%, p = 0.03). The Delta VOC had a higher risk than wild-type infection in deterioration to critical status (hazards ratio 2.98 [95%CI 1.29-6.86]; p = 0.01). INTERPRETATION: Infection with the Delta VOC is characterized by markedly increased transmissibility, viral loads and risk of disease progression compared with the wild-type strain, calling for more intensive prevention and control measures to contain future outbreaks.

66	10.1016/j.envres.2021.111653	Less than a year following the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, variants of concern have emerged in the form of variant Alpha (B.1.1.7, the British variant) and Beta (B.1.351, the South Africa variant). Due to their high infectivity and morbidity, it has become clear that it is crucial to quickly and effectively detect these and other variants. Here, we report improved primers-probe sets for reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for SARS-CoV-2 detection including a rapid, cost-effective, and direct RT-qPCR method for detection of the two variants of concern (Alpha, B.1.1.7 and Beta, B.1.351). All the developed primers-probe sets were fully characterized, demonstrating sensitive and specific detection. These primer-probe sets were also successfully employed on wastewater samples aimed at detecting and even quantifying new variants in a geographical area, even prior to the reports by the medical testing. The novel primers-probe sets presented here will enable proper responses for pandemic containment, particularly considering the emergence of variants of concern.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: infectivity, fatality_rate, effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics

68	10.1016/j.genrep.2020.100997	The ongoing mutations in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are the major impediment for prevention and control of the COVID-19 disease. Presently we focused on evolution of the envelope (E) protein, one of the most enigmatic and less studied protein among the four structural proteins (S, E, M and N) associated with multitude of immunopathological functions of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we comprehensively analyzed 81,818 high quality E protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 globally available in the GISAID database as of 20 August 2020. Compared to Wuhan reference strain, our mutational analysis explored only 1.2 % (982/81818) mutant strains undergoing a total of 115 unique amino acid (aa) substitutions in the E protein, highlighting the fact that most (98.8 %) of the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 strains are highly conserved. Moreover, we found 58.77 % (134 of 228) nucleotides (nt) positions of SARS-CoV-2 E gene encountering a total of 176 unique nt-level mutations globally, which may affect the efficacy of real time RT-PCR-based molecular detection of COVID-19. Importantly, higher aa variations observed in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the E protein, particularly at Ser(55)-Phe(56), Arg(69) and the C-terminal end (DLLV: 72–75) may alter the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Envelope protein to tight junction-associated PALS1 and thus could play a key role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Furthermore, this study revealed the V25A mutation in the transmembrane domain which is a key factor for the homopentameric conformation of E protein. Our analysis also observed a triple cysteine motif harboring mutation (L39M, A41S, A41V, C43F, C43R, C43S, C44Y, N45R) which may hinder the binding of E protein with spike glycoprotein. These results therefore suggest the continuous monitoring of the structural proteins including the envelope protein of SARS-CoV-2 since the number of genome sequences from across the world are continuously increasing.	mutation_name: E_V25A | effect_list: protein_conformational_optimization
69	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.08.003	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate changes in COVID-19 patients' characteristics occurring after the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) P.1 (Gamma) by comparing the clinical, demographic and laboratory profile of patients hospitalized during the first (May-July 2020) and second (December 2020 - February 2021) pandemic waves. METHODS: Data was collected from records of COVID-19 patients (n=4164) admitted to a single hospital in Salvador, Northeast Brazil. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was performed in nasopharyngeal swab samples from 12 patients with age < 60 years-old admitted to the intensive care units (ICU) in February 2021. RESULTS: From June 2020 to February 2021, the median age of patients admitted in the ICU decreased from 66 to 58 years (p<0.05), accompanied by an increased proportion of patients without comorbidities (15.32% vs 32.20%, p<0.0001). A significant reduction in the Ct values of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests was observed in the second wave (p<0.0001). Sequencing analysis detected lineage Gamma in all 12 ICU patients sampled in February 2021. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated an increased proportion of younger adults without comorbidities with severe disease during the second COVID-19 wave, shortly after the confirmation of local Gamma circulation.	mutation_name: P.1 | effect_list: disease_severity, ct_value
70	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.11.006	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic. Additionally, several SARS-CoV-2 variants have continuously challenged diagnostic testing due to viral diversity in spike and nucleocapsid (N) protein mutations. SARS-CoV-2-variant proliferation potentially affects N protein-targeted rapid antigen testing. We performed rapid antigen and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests simultaneously in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To determine the N protein variations, direct whole-genome sequencing was performed, and the viral assemblies were uploaded to GISAID. We compared their genomes with those of global virus strains from GISAID. These isolates belonged to the B.1.1.7 variant, exhibiting several amino acid substitutions, including D3L, R203K, G204R, and S235F N protein mutations. We also identified the T135I mutation in one variant case in which rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests were discordantly negative and positive, respectively. Our findings suggest that the variants undetected by the PanbioTM COVID-19 rapid antigen test may be due to N-protein T135I mutations, posing a potential diagnostic risk to commercially available antigen tests. Hence, we recommend concomitant paired rapid antigen tests and molecular diagnostic methods to detect SARS-CoV-2. False-negative results could be rapidly corrected using confirmatory RT-PCR results to prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks.	mutation_name: N_T135I | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics

Methods We included 1000 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected clinical data from 997, and obtained 678 whole genome sequences by massively parallel sequencing. Bivariate, multivariate, and classification and regression tree analyses were run between clinical and genomic variables. Results Age and infection with lineages B.1.1, B.1.1.388, B.1.523, and B.1.621 were related to lethality for patients 71-88 years old (OR: 6.048036; 95% CI 1.346567-32.92521, p-value: 0.01718674). The need for hospitalization was associated with higher age and comorbidities. For patients 38-51 years old infected with lineages A, B, B.1.1.388, B.1.1.434, B.1.153, B.1.36.10, B.1.411, B.1.471, B.1.558 or B.1.621, hospitalization rate increased significantly (OR 8.368427, 95% CI 2.573145-39.10672, p-value: 0.00012). Associations between clades and clinical outcomes diverged from previously reported data. Conclusions Lineage B.1.621 increased the need for hospitalization and lethality. Our findings, plus the rapidly increasing prevalence in Colombia and other countries, suggest broadly considering it as a Variant of Interest.

For patients 38-51 years old infected with lineages A, B, B.1.1.388, B.1.1.434, B.1.153, B.1.36.10, B.1.411, B.1.471, B.1.558 or B.1.621, hospitalization rate increased significantly (OR 8.368427, 95% CI 2.573145-39.10672, p-value: 0.00012). Associations between clades and clinical outcomes diverged from previously reported data. Conclusions Lineage B.1.621 increased the need for hospitalization and lethality. Our findings, plus the rapidly increasing prevalence in Colombia and other countries, suggest broadly considering it as a Variant of Interest. If associated disease severity is confirmed, possible designation as Variant of Concern could be entertained.	mutation_name: B.1.621 | effect_list: fatality_rate, risk_of_hospitalization
83	10.1016/j.ijid.2021.12.362	The Delta variant of concern (VOC) of SARS-CoV-2 has become dominant worldwide. We report here a cluster caused by B.1.617.2 harboring the additional mutation of concern (MOC) F490S. Infection occurred in 5 fully vaccinated subjects between the ages of 47 and 84. The immune escape mutation F490S, first identified in the Lambda VOI, appears to impair vaccine efficacy and is rapidly increasing in prevalence worldwide.	mutation_name: SPIKE_F490S | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, immune_escape
84	10.1016/j.ijid.2022.03.001	The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron strain emergence raised concerns that its enhanced infectivity is partly due to altered spread/contamination modalities. We therefore sampled high-contact surfaces and air in close proximity to patients verified as infected with Omicron strain, using identical protocols applied to sample patients positive to the original or Alpha strains. Cumulatively, for all three strains, viral-RNA was detected in 90/168 surfaces and 6/49 air samples (mean Ct=35.2±2.5). No infective virus was identified. No significant differences in prevalence were found between strains	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: infectivity
85	10.1016/j.immuni.2021.03.023	Interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the receptor ACE2 on host cells is essential for viral entry. RBD is the dominant target for neutralizing antibodies, and several neutralizing epitopes on RBD have been molecularly characterized. Analysis of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has revealed mutations arising in the RBD, N-terminal domain (NTD) and S2 subunits of Spike. To understand how these mutations affect Spike antigenicity, we isolated and characterized >100 monoclonal antibodies targeting epitopes on RBD, NTD, and S2 from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Approximately 45% showed neutralizing activity, of which ∼20% were NTD specific. NTD-specific antibodies formed two distinct groups: the first was highly potent against infectious virus, whereas the second was less potent and displayed glycan-dependant neutralization activity. Mutations present in B.1.1.7 Spike frequently conferred neutralization resistance to NTD-specific antibodies. This work demonstrates that neutralizing antibodies targeting subdominant epitopes should be considered when investigating antigenic drift in emerging variants.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_antibodies
86	10.1016/j.intimp.2021.108424	SARS-CoV2 mutants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 contain a key mutation N501Y. B.1.135 and P.1 lineages have another mutation, E484K. Here, we decode the effect of these two mutations on the host receptor, ACE2, and neutralizing antibody (B38) recognition. The N501Y RBD mutant binds to ACE2 with higher affinity due to improved π-π stacking and π-cation interactions. The higher binding affinity of the E484K mutant is caused due to the formation of additional hydrogen bond and salt-bridge interactions with ACE2. Both the mutants bind to the B38 antibody with reduced affinity due to the loss of several hydrogen-bonding interactions. The insights obtained from the study are crucial to interpret the increased transmissibility and reduced neutralization efficacy of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV2 VOCs.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect_list: binding_to_host_receptor, intermolecular_interactions

88	10.1016/j.isci.2021.102257	Viruses interact extensively with the host molecular machinery, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Bacteriophage T7 recruits the small protein thioredoxin of the Escherichia coli host as an essential processivity factor for the viral DNA polymerase. We challenged the phage to propagate in a host in which thioredoxin had been extensively modified to hamper its recruitment. The virus adapted to the engineered host without losing the capability to propagate in the original host, but no genetic mutations were fixed in the thioredoxin binding domain of the viral DNA polymerase. Virus adaptation correlated with mutations in the viral RNA polymerase, supporting that promiscuous thioredoxin recruitment was enabled by phenotypic mutations caused by transcription errors. These results point to a mechanism of virus adaptation that may play a role in cross-species transmission. We propose that phenotypic mutations may generally contribute to the capability of viruses to evade antiviral strategies.	mutation_name:  | effect_list:

99	10.1016/j.isci.2021.103589	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha), a WHO variant of concern (VOC) first identified in the UK in late 2020, contains several mutations including P681H in the spike S1/S2 cleavage site, which is predicted to increase cleavage by furin, potentially impacting the viral cell entry. Here, we studied the role of the P681H mutation in B.1.1.7 cell entry. We performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.1.7 S1/S2 sequence and observed no significant difference in furin cleavage. Functional assays using pseudoparticles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spikes and cell-to-cell fusion assays demonstrated no differences between Wuhan-Hu-1, B.1.1.7 or a P681H point mutant. Likewise, we observed no differences in viral growth between USA-WA1/2020 and a B.1.1.7 isolate in cell culture. Our findings suggest that while the B.1.1.7 P681H mutation may slightly increase S1/S2 cleavage this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: entry_efficiency

101	10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102715	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly evolving in the form of new variants. At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (≥20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (≥20 %) than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.	mutation_name: AY.1 | effect_list: binding_to_antibodies, protein_conformational_optimization
102	10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102779	Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been emerging in the form of different variants since its first emergence in early December 2019. A new Variant of Concern (VOC) named the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was reported recently. This variant has a large number of mutations in the S protein. To date, there exists a limited information on the Omicron variant. Here we present the analyses of mutation distribution, the evolutionary relationship of Omicron with previous variants, and probable structural impact of mutations on antibody binding. Our analyses show the presence of 46 high prevalence mutations specific to Omicron. Twenty-three of these are localized within the spike (S) protein and the rest localized to the other 3 structural proteins of the virus, the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Omicron is closely related to the Gamma (P.1) variant. The structural analyses showed that several mutations are localized to the region of the S protein that is the major target of antibodies, suggesting that the mutations in the Omicron variant may affect the binding affinities of antibodies to the S protein.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect_list: binding_to_antibodies

Several FDA authorized molecular diagnostic tests have been impacted by viral variation, while no reports of viral variation affecting antigen test performance have occurred to date. While determining the analytical sensitivity of the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test (Sofia 2), we uncovered a high viral load specimen that repeatedly tested negative by this antigen test. Whole genome sequencing of the specimen uncovered two mutations, T205I and D399N, present in the nucleocapsid protein of the isolate. All six SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens available in our laboratory with a D399N nucleocapsid mutation and C(T) < 31 were not detected by the Sofia 2 but detected by the Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 Ag Card, while clinical specimens with the T205I mutation were detected by both assays. Testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid with these variants demonstrated an approximate 1000-fold loss in sensitivity for the Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA test associated with the D399N mutation, while the BinaxNOW and Quidel Quickvue SARS Antigen tests were unaffected by the mutation. The D399N nucleocapsid mutation has been relatively uncommon to date, appearing in only 0.02% of genomes worldwide at time of writing. Our results demonstrate how routine pathogen genomics can be integrated into the clinical microbiology laboratory to investigate diagnostic edge cases, as well as the importance of profiling antigenic diversity outside of the spike protein for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.	mutation_name: E_T205I | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics

Our high-volume laboratory introduced a PCR variant assay (Variant PCR) in January 2021 based on the protocol by Vogels et al. STUDY DESIGN: : To assess whether Variant PCR could be used for rapid B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 screening, all positive SARS-CoV-2 airway samples were prospectively tested in parallel using both the Variant PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: : In total 1,642 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from individual patients were tested within a time span of 4 weeks. For all samples with valid results from both Variant PCR and WGS, no VoC was missed by Variant PCR (totalling 399 VoC detected). Conversely, all of the samples identified as “other lineages” (i.e., “non-VoC lineages”) by the Variant PCR, were confirmed by WGS. CONCLUSIONS: : The Variant PCR based on the protocol by Vogels et al., is an effective method for rapid screening for VoC, applicable for most diagnostic laboratories within a pandemic setting. WGS is still required to confirm the identity of certain variants and for continuous surveillance of emerging VoC.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission, immune_escape, effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics

107	10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104906	OBJECTIVES: : The emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC), B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, with increased transmission and/or immune evasion, emphasise the need for broad and rapid variant monitoring. Our high-volume laboratory introduced a PCR variant assay (Variant PCR) in January 2021 based on the protocol by Vogels et al. STUDY DESIGN: : To assess whether Variant PCR could be used for rapid B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 screening, all positive SARS-CoV-2 airway samples were prospectively tested in parallel using both the Variant PCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: : In total 1,642 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from individual patients were tested within a time span of 4 weeks. For all samples with valid results from both Variant PCR and WGS, no VoC was missed by Variant PCR (totalling 399 VoC detected). Conversely, all of the samples identified as “other lineages” (i.e., “non-VoC lineages”) by the Variant PCR, were confirmed by WGS. CONCLUSIONS: : The Variant PCR based on the protocol by Vogels et al., is an effective method for rapid screening for VoC, applicable for most diagnostic laboratories within a pandemic setting. WGS is still required to confirm the identity of certain variants and for continuous surveillance of emerging VoC.	mutation_name: P.1 | effect_list: viral_transmission, immune_escape, effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics
108	10.1016/j.jksus.2021.101773	Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world jeopardizing the global economy and health. The rapid proliferation and infectivity of the virus can be attributed to many accumulating mutations in the spike protein leading to continuous generation of variants. The spike protein is a glycoprotein that recognizes and binds to cell surface receptor known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) leading to the fusion of the viral and host cell membranes and entry into the host cells. These circulating variants in the population have greatly impacted the virulence, transmissibility, and immunological evasion of the host. The present study is aimed at understanding the impact of the major mutations (L452R, T478K and N501Y) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and their consequences on the binding affinity to human ACE2 through protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. Protein-protein docking and Molecular mechanics with generalised Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) binding free energy analysis reveal that the spike mutants-L452R, T478K and N501Y have a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 as compared to the native spike protein. The increase in the number of interface residues, interface area and intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges and non-bonded contacts corroborated with the increase in the binding affinity of the spike mutants to ACE2. Further, 75 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulation investigations show variations in the geometric properties such as root mean square deviation (RMSD), radius of gyration (Rg), total solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and number of hydrogen bonds (NHBs) in the mutant spike:ACE2 complexes with respect to the native spike:ACE2 complex. Therefore, the findings of this study unravel plausible molecular mechanisms of increase in binding affinity of spike mutants (L452R, T478K and N501Y) to human ACE2 leading to higher virulence and infectivity of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. The study will further aid in designing novel therapeutics targeting the interface residues between spike protein and ACE2 receptor.	mutation_name: SPIKE_L452R | effect_list: binding_to_host_receptor, intermolecular_interactions, protein_conformational_optimization, viral_virulence, infectivity

111	10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114428	BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended RT-qPCR tests as the reference technique for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection, however with the rapid spread of the infection, mutations in specific RT-qPCR target regions have been widely described could allow the presumptive identification. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we evaluated the analytical performance of the Allplex™SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay for the additional presumptive identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a real-life setting. RESULTS: We observed gene-specific changes in the cycle threshold (Ct) of the N and RdRp genes compared with the Ct yielded for the S gene when the SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed Allplex™SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay. Seventeen samples showed Ct variations in the N and/or RdRp. In 10 cases, the N gene was affected, delayed or negative and in 14 cases, the RdRp gene showed a delay or negative concerning the S gene. A delay in the Ct of both genes (RdRp and N) was observed in six cases. Sequencing determined that all samples identified as B.1.1.7 showed changes in the PCR curves of the N and RdRp. However, samples identified as B.1.177 only showed variations for the RdRp gene. CONCLUSIONS: Allplex™SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay, the diagnosis could presumably allow the rapid assignment of lineages B.1.1.7 and B.1.177, and emphasizes the importance of exhaustive surveillance for circulating variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to reduce community transmission.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: ct_value, effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics

113	10.1016/j.medidd.2021.100086	SARS-CoV-2 is a global challenge due to its ability to spread much faster than the SARS-CoV, which was attributed to the mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD). These mutations enhanced the electrostatic interactions. Recently, a new strain is reported in the UK that includes a mutation (N501Y) in the RBD, that is possibly increasing the infection rate. Here, using Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, we show that the N501 mutation enhanced the electrostatic interactions due to the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between SARS-CoV-2-T500 and ACE2-D355 near the mutation site. In addition, we observed that the electrostatic interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the wild type and the mutant are dominated by salt-bridges formed between SARS-CoV-2-K417 and ACE2-D30, SARS-CoV-2-K458, ACE2-E23, and SARS-CoV-2-R403 and ACE2-E37. These interactions contributed more than 40% of the total binding energies.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N501Y | effect_list: intermolecular_interactions, binding_to_host_receptor
114	10.1016/j.medj.2022.03.004	Background The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has proven highly transmissible and has outcompeted the Delta variant in many regions of the world. Early reports have also suggested that Omicron may result in less severe clinical disease in humans. Here we show that Omicron is less pathogenic than prior SARS-CoV-2 variants in Syrian golden hamsters. Methods Hamsters were inoculated with either SARS-CoV-2 Omicron or other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Animals were followed for weight loss, and upper and lower respiratory tract tissues were assessed for viral loads and histopathology. Findings Infection of hamsters with the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020, Alpha, Beta, or Delta strains led to 4-10% weight loss by day 4 and 10-17% weight loss by day 6. In contrast, infection of hamsters with two different Omicron challenge stocks did not result in any detectable weight loss, even at high challenge doses. Omicron infection led to substantial viral replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts but demonstrated lower viral loads in lung parenchyma and reduced pulmonary pathology compared with WA1/2020 infection. Conclusions These data suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant may result in robust upper respiratory tract infection but less severe lower respiratory tract clinical disease compared with prior SARS-CoV-2 variants.

118	10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104815	The D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein emerged in early 2020 and quickly became the dominant circulating strain in Europe and its environs. The variant was characterized by the higher viral load, which is not associated with disease severity, higher incorporation into the virion, and high cell entry via ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. Previous strains of the coronavirus and the current SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated the selection of mutations as a mechanism of escaping immune responses. In this study, we used molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA binding energy analysis to provide insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and describe the neutralization mechanism of this variant. Our results show that the D614G S-protein adopts distinct conformational dynamics which is skewed towards the open-state conformation more than the closed-state conformation of the wild-type S-protein. Residue-specific variation of amino acid flexibility and domain-specific RMSD suggest that the mutation causes an allosteric conformational change in the RBD. Evaluation of the interaction energies between the S-protein and neutralizing antibodies show that the mutation may enhance, reduce or not affect the neutralizing interactions depending on the neutralizing antibody, especially if it targets the RBD. The results of this study have shed insights into the behaviour of the D614G S-protein at the molecular level and provided a glimpse of the neutralization mechanism of this variant.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: viral_load, disease_severity, entry_efficiency, protein_conformational_optimization, sensitivity_to_antibodies
119	10.1016/j.meegid.2021.104941	The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected millions of people since its beginning in 2019. The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020, the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October 2020, more than 40% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P.1, P.2 and B.1.1.33 - posteriorly renamed as N.9) in four Brazilian regions. We also evaluated the presence of E484K associated mutations and identified selective pressures acting on the spike protein, leading us to some insights about adaptive and purifying selection driving the virus evolution.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect_list: immune_escape, risk_of_reinfection

METHODS: A single centre retrospective cohort study was conducted in 1760 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of Nextstrain clades 20A, 20B, and 20C (first phase, February–May 2020), Pangolin lineages B.1.177 (we named Marseille-2) and B.1.160 (Marseille-4) variants (second phase, June–December 2020), and B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and A.27 (Marseille-501) variants (third phase, January 2021-today). Outcomes were the occurrence of clinical failures, including hospitalisation, transfer to the intensive-care unit, and death. RESULTS: During each phase, no major differences were observed with regards to age and gender distribution, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and clinical symptoms between variants circulating in a given phase. The B.1.177 and B.1.160 variants were associated with more severe outcomes. Infections occurring during the second phase were associated with a higher rate of death as compared to infections during the first and third phases. Patients in the second phase were more likely to be hospitalised than those in the third phase. Patients infected during the third phase were more frequently obese than others.

122	10.1016/j.meegid.2022.105279	As surges of the COVID-19 pandemic continue globally, including in Palestine, several new SARS-CoV-2 variants have been introduced. This expansion has impacted transmission, disease severity, virulence, diagnosis, therapy, and natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Here, 183 whole genome sequences (WGS) were analyzed, of which 129 were from Palestinian cases, 62 of which were collected in 11 Palestinian districts between October 2020 and April 2021and sequenced completely . A dramatic shift from the wild type to the Alpha variant (B 1.1.7) was observed within a short period of time. Cluster mapping revealed statistically significant clades in two main Palestinian cities, Al-Khalil (Monte Carlo hypothesis test-Poisson model, P = 0.00000000012) and Nablus (Monte Carlo hypothesis test-Poisson model, P = 0.014 and 0.015). The phylogenetic tree showed three main clusters of SARS-CoV-2 with high bootstrap values (>90). However, population genetics analysis showed a genetically homogenous population supported by low Wright's F-statistic values (Fst <0.25), high gene flow (Nm > 3), and statistically insignificant Tajima's D values (Tajima's test, neutrality model prediction, P = 0.02). The Alpha variant, rapidly replaced the wild type, causing a major surge that peaked in April 2021, with an increased COVID-19 mortality rate, especially, in the Al-Khalil and Nablus districts. The source of introduction remains uncertain, despite the minimal genetic variation. The study substantiates the use of WGS for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance as an early warning system to track down new variants requiring effective control.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: fatality_rate
123	10.1016/j.molcel.2022.03.028	Aided by extensive spike protein mutation, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant overtook the previously dominant Delta variant. Spike conformation plays an essential role in SARS-CoV-2 evolution via changes in receptor binding domain (RBD) and neutralizing antibody epitope presentation affecting virus transmissibility and immune evasion. Here, we determine cryo-EM structures of the Omicron and Delta spikes to understand the conformational impacts of mutations in each. The Omicron spike structure revealed an unusually tightly packed RBD organization with long range impacts that were not observed in the Delta spike. Binding and crystallography revealed increased flexibility at the functionally critical fusion peptide site in the Omicron spike. These results reveal a highly evolved Omicron spike architecture with possible impacts on its high levels of immune evasion and transmissibility.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: protein_flexibility, protein_functioning, immune_escape, viral_transmission, protein_conformational_optimization

129	10.1016/s0140-6736(22)00327-0	BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, omicron, appears to be less severe than delta. We aim to quantify the differences in symptom prevalence, risk of hospital admission, and symptom duration among the vaccinated population. METHODS: In this prospective longitudinal observational study, we collected data from participants who were self-reporting test results and symptoms in the ZOE COVID app (previously known as the COVID Symptoms Study App). Eligible participants were aged 16–99 years, based in the UK, with a body-mass index between 15 and 55 kg/m(2), had received at least two doses of any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, were symptomatic, and logged a positive symptomatic PCR or lateral flow result for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. The primary outcome was the likelihood of developing a given symptom (of the 32 monitored in the app) or hospital admission within 7 days before or after the positive test in participants infected during omicron prevalence compared with those infected during delta prevalence. FINDINGS: Between June 1, 2021, and Jan 17, 2022, we identified 63 002 participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and reported symptoms in the ZOE app. These patients were matched 1:1 for age, sex, and vaccination dose, across two periods (June 1 to Nov 27, 2021, delta prevalent at >70%; n=4990, and Dec 20, 2021, to Jan 17, 2022, omicron prevalent at >70%; n=4990). Loss of smell was less common in participants infected during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (16·7% vs 52·7%, odds ratio [OR] 0·17; 95% CI 0·16–0·19, p<0·001). Sore throat was more common during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (70·5% vs 60·8%, 1·55; 1·43–1·69, p<0·001). There was a lower rate of hospital admission during omicron prevalence than during delta prevalence (1·9% vs 2·6%, OR 0·75; 95% CI 0·57–0·98, p=0·03). INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of symptoms that characterise an omicron infection differs from those of the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant, apparently with less involvement of the lower respiratory tract and reduced probability of hospital admission. Our data indicate a shorter period of illness and potentially of infectiousness which should impact work–health policies and public health advice.

130	10.1016/s1473-3099(21)00170-5	BACKGROUND: Emergence of variants with specific mutations in key epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 raises concerns pertinent to mass vaccination campaigns and use of monoclonal antibodies. We aimed to describe the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC), including virological characteristics and clinical severity in contemporaneous patients with and without the variant. METHODS: In this cohort study, samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR that were collected from Nov 9, 2020, for patients acutely admitted to one of two hospitals on or before Dec 20, 2020, in London, UK, were sequenced and analysed for the presence of VOC-defining mutations. We fitted Poisson regression models to investigate the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease (defined as point 6 or higher on the WHO ordinal scale within 14 days of symptoms or positive test) and death within 28 days of a positive test and did supplementary genomic analyses in a cohort of chronically shedding patients and in a cohort of remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load was compared by proxy, using PCR cycle threshold values and sequencing read depths. FINDINGS: Of 496 patients with samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 on PCR and who met inclusion criteria, 341 had samples that could be sequenced. 198 (58%) of 341 had B.1.1.7 infection and 143 (42%) had non-B.1.1.7 infection. We found no evidence of an association between severe disease and death and lineage (B.1.1.7 vs non-B.1.1.7) in unadjusted analyses (prevalence ratio [PR] 0·97 [95% CI 0·72–1·31]), or in analyses adjusted for hospital, sex, age, comorbidities, and ethnicity (adjusted PR 1·02 [0·76–1·38]). We detected no B.1.1.7 VOC-defining mutations in 123 chronically shedding immunocompromised patients or in 32 remdesivir-treated patients. Viral load by proxy was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold value (mean 28·8 [SD 4·7] vs 32·0 [4·8]; p=0·0085) and genomic read depth (1280 [1004] vs 831 [682]; p=0·0011). INTERPRETATION: Emerging evidence exists of increased transmissibility of B.1.1.7, and we found increased virus load by proxy for B.1.1.7 in our data. We did not identify an association of the variant with severe disease in this hospitalised cohort.

131	10.1016/s2213-2600(22)00045-5	BACKGROUND: Reports have suggested that the efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant replaced the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant as the predominant variant. We aimed to investigate, for the two main classes of vaccine, whether efficacy against severe COVID-19 has decreased since delta became the predominant variant and whether the efficacy of two doses of vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes with time since second dose. METHODS: In the REACT-SCOT case-control study, vaccine efficacy was estimated using a matched case-control design that includes all diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Scotland up to Sept 8, 2021. For every incident case of COVID-19 in the Scottish population, ten controls matched for age rounded to the nearest year, sex, and primary care practice, and alive on the day of presentation of the case that they were matched to were selected using the Community Health Index database. To minimise ascertainment bias we prespecified the primary outcome measure to assess vaccine efficacy as severe COVID-19, defined as diagnosed patients with entry to critical care within 21 days of first positive test, death within 28 days of first positive test, or any death for which COVID-19 was coded as underlying cause. Although the data extracted for this study included cases presenting up to Sept 22, 2021, the analyses reported here are restricted to cases and controls presenting from Dec 1, 2020, to Sept 8, 2021, ensuring follow-up for at least 14 days after presentation date to allow classification of hospitalisation and (for most cases) severity based on entry to critical care or fatal outcome. FINDINGS: During the study period, a total of 5645 severe cases of COVID-19 were recorded; these were matched to 50 096 controls. Of the severe cases, 4495 (80%) were not vaccinated, and of the controls, 36 879 (74%) were not vaccinated. Of the severe cases of COVID-19 who had been vaccinated, 389 had received an mRNA vaccine and 759 had received the ChAdOx1 vaccine. The efficacy of vaccination against severe COVID-19 decreased in May, 2021, coinciding with the replacement of the alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant by the delta variant in Scotland, but this decrease was reversed over the following month. In the most recent time window centred on July 29, 2021, the efficacy of two doses was 91% (95% CI 87–94) for the ChAdOx1 vaccine and 92% (88–95) for mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) vaccines. The efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 declined with time since second dose to 69% (95% CI 52–80) at 20 weeks from second dose. The efficacy of mRNA vaccines declined in the first ten weeks from second dose but more slowly thereafter to 93% (88–96) at 20 weeks from second dose. INTERPRETATION: Our results are reassuring with respect to concerns that vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 might have fallen since the delta variant became predominant, or that efficacy of mRNA vaccines wanes within the first 5–6 months after second dose. However, the efficacy of the ChAdOx1 vaccine against severe COVID-19 wanes substantially by 20 weeks from second dose. Efficacy of mRNA vaccines after 20 weeks and against newer variants remains to be established. Our findings support the case for additional protective measures for those at risk of severe disease, including, but not limited to, booster doses, at times when transmission rates are high or expected to rise.

132	10.1017/s0950268820002198	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a tremendous impact in China and abroad since its onset in December 2019 and poses a major threat to human health. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of the response to outbreaks. This study reviewed literature data and found that HCWs were at high risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially at the early stage of the epidemic, and many factors greatly affected their occupational safety. Although SARS-CoV-2 transmission was controlled in China, the Chinese experience can help protect HCWs from COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases.	mutation_name:  | effect_list: 
133	10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c01626	[Image: see text] The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that started in late 2019 is responsible for hundreds of millions of cases worldwide and millions of fatalities. Though vaccines are available, the virus is mutating to form new strains among which are the variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 that demonstrate increased transmissivity and infectivity. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to explore the role of the mutations in the interaction of the virus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) with the host receptor ACE2. We find that the hydrogen bond networks are rearranged in the variants and also that new hydrogen bonds are established between the RBD and ACE2 as a result of mutations. We investigated three variants: the wild-type (WT), B.1.1.7, and B.1.351. We find that the B.1.351 variant (also known as 501Y.V2) shows larger flexibility in the RBD loop segment involving residue K484, yet the RBD–ACE2 complex shows higher stability. Mutations that allow a more flexible interface that can result in a more stable complex may be a factor contributing to the increased infectivity of the mutated variants.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission, infectivity

135	10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00410	[Image: see text] With the COVID-19 pandemic, the evolutionary fate of SARS-CoV-2 becomes a matter of utmost concern. Mutation D614G in the spike (S) protein has become dominant, and recent evidence suggests it yields a more stable phenotype with higher transmission efficacy. We carry out a structural analysis that provides mechanistic clues on the enhanced infectivity. The D614G substitution creates a sticky packing defect in subunit S1, promoting its association with subunit S2 as a means to stabilize the structure of S1 within the S1/S2 complex. The results raise the therapeutic possibility of immunologically targeting the epitope involved in stabilizing the G614 phenotype as a means of reducing the infection efficacy of SARS-CoV-2. This therapeutic modality would not a-priori interfere directly with current efforts toward the immunological targeting of the RBD epitope; hence, it could be exploited as a complementary treatment.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: viral_transmission, infectivity, protein_conformational_optimization, protein_stability
136	10.1038/s41467-021-21118-2	The causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is steadily mutating during continuous transmission among humans. Such mutations can occur in the spike (S) protein that binds to the ACE2 receptor and is cleaved by TMPRSS2. However, whether S mutations affect SARS-CoV-2 cell entry remains unknown. Here, we show that naturally occurring S mutations can reduce or enhance cell entry via ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped lentivirus exhibits substantially lower entry than that of SARS-CoV S. Among S variants, the D614G mutant shows the highest cell entry, as supported by structural and binding analyses. Nevertheless, the D614G mutation does not affect neutralization by antisera against prototypic viruses. Taken together, we conclude that the D614G mutation increases cell entry by acquiring higher affinity to ACE2 while maintaining neutralization susceptibility. Based on these findings, further worldwide surveillance is required to understand SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility among humans.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, entry_efficiency, binding_to_host_receptor
137	10.1038/s41467-021-24339-7	The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic necessitates the fast development of vaccines. Recently, viral mutants termed variants of concern (VOC) which may escape host immunity have emerged. The efficacy of spike encoding mRNA vaccines (CVnCoV and CV2CoV) against the ancestral strain and the VOC B.1.351 was tested in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with a formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice develop elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody and neutralization titers which are readily detectable, but significantly reduced against VOC B.1.351. The mRNA vaccines fully protect from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. SARS-CoV-2 remains undetected in swabs, lung, or brain in these groups. Despite lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to the ancestral strain BavPat1, CVnCoV and CV2CoV show complete disease protection against the novel VOC B.1.351 in our studies.	mutation_name: B.1.351 | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines
138	10.1038/s41467-021-25168-4	Wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is critical to tracking viral evolution during the ongoing pandemic. We develop the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detect an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage. In concert with other variants, like B.1.1.7, the rise of B.1.526 appears to have extended the duration of the second wave of COVID-19 cases in NYC in early 2021. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, supporting the public health relevance of this lineage.	mutation_name: B.1.526 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera, viral_transmission

141	10.1038/s41467-022-29104-y	SARS-CoV-2 remdesivir resistance mutations have been generated in vitro but have not been reported in patients receiving treatment with the antiviral agent. We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with acquired B-cell deficiency who developed an indolent, protracted course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient virologic response, but her course was complicated by recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding. Whole genome sequencing identified a mutation, E802D, in the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which was not present in pre-treatment specimens. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation conferred a ~6-fold increase in remdesivir IC(50) but resulted in a fitness cost in the absence of remdesivir. Sustained clinical and virologic response was achieved after treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab. Although the fitness cost observed in vitro may limit the risk posed by E802D, this case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.	mutation_name: NSP12_E802D | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs
142	10.1038/s41564-021-01047-y	The major transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 is airborne. However, previous studies could not elucidate the contribution between large droplets and aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Here, we designed and validated an optimized transmission caging setup, which allows for the assessment of aerosol transmission efficiency at various distances. At a distance of 2 m, only particles of <5 µm traversed between cages. Using this setup, we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission between the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) and lineage A in Syrian hamsters. Aerosol transmission of both variants was confirmed in all sentinels after 24 h of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory virus shedding and seroconversion. Productive transmission also occurred after 1 h of exposure, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, after donors were infected with a mix of both variants, the Alpha variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain. Overall, these data indicate that a lower infectious dose of the Alpha variant, compared to lineage A, could be sufficient for successful transmission. This highlights the continuous need to assess emerging variants and the development for pre-emptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission, infectivity
143	10.1038/s41586-021-03361-1	During the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans a D614G substitution in the spike (S) protein emerged and became the predominant circulating variant (S-614G) of the COVID-19 pandemic1. However, whether the increasing prevalence of the S-614G variant represents a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains elusive. Here, we generated isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate that the S-614G variant has (i) enhanced binding to human host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), (ii) increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a novel human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and (iii) markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our data show that while the S-614G substitution results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro, it provides a real competitive advantage in vivo, particularly during the transmission bottle neck, providing an explanation for the global predominance of S-614G variant among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses currently circulating.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: viral_transmission, binding_to_host_receptor, viral_replication

It is unclear whether responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the prototypic strain will be impacted by mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralising antibody responses following first and second immunisations using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein. The vaccine sera exhibited a broad range of neutralising titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against B.1.1.7 variant.

This B.1.1.7 variant, also known as Alpha, increased rapidly in prevalence, attributed to an increase in infection and/or transmission efficiency1. The Alpha variant has 19 nonsynonymous mutations across its viral genome, including 8 substitutions or deletions in the spike protein, which interacts with cellular receptors to mediate infection and tropism. Here, using a reverse genetics approach, we show that, of the 8 individual spike protein substitutions, only N501Y exhibited consistent fitness gains for replication in the upper airway in the hamster model as well as primary human airway epithelial cells. The N501Y substitution recapitulated the phenotype of enhanced viral transmission seen with the combined 8 Alpha spike mutations, suggesting it is a major determinant of increased transmission of this variant. Mechanistically, the N501Y substitution improved the affinity of the viral spike protein for cellular receptors. As suggested by its convergent evolution in Brazil, South Africa, and elsewhere2,3, our results indicate that N501Y substitution is a major adaptive spike mutation of major concern.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: infectivity, viral_transmission

148	10.1038/s41586-022-04442-5	SARS-CoV-2 Omicron emerged in November 2021 and is rapidly spreading among the human population1. While recent reports reveal that the Omicron variant robustly escapes from vaccine and therapeutic neutralization antibodies2-10, the pathogenicity of the virus remains unknown. Here we show that the replication of the Omicron variant is dramatically attenuated in Calu3 and Caco2 cells. Further mechanistic investigations reveal that the Omicron variant is inefficient in transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) usage in comparison to that of WT and previous variants, which may explain its reduced replication in Calu3 and Caco2 cells. Omicron replication is markedly attenuated in both the upper and lower respiratory tract of infected K18-hACE2 mice in comparison to that of WT and Delta variant, which results in its dramatically ameliorated lung pathology. When compared with SARS-CoV-2 WT, Alpha, Beta, and Delta variant, infection by the Omicron variant causes the least body weight loss and mortality rate. Overall, our study demonstrates that the Omicron variant is attenuated in virus replication and pathogenicity in mice in comparison with WT and previous variants.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs, viral_replication, disease_severity, fatality_rate

Here, we show that pseudovirus expressing 501Y.V2 spike protein completely escapes three classes of therapeutically relevant antibodies. This pseudovirus also exhibits substantial to complete escape from neutralization, but not binding, by convalescent plasma. These data highlight the prospect of reinfection with antigenically distinct variants and foreshadows reduced efficacy of spike-based vaccines.	mutation_name: B.1.351 | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, sensitivity_to_antibodies, sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, risk_of_reinfection, binding_to_antibodies
150	10.1038/s41591-021-01318-5	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants were first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, respectively, and have since spread to many countries. These variants harboring diverse mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein raise important concerns about their immune evasion potential. Here, we isolated infectious B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains from acutely infected individuals. We examined sensitivity of the two variants to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies present in sera and nasal swabs from individuals infected with previously circulating strains or who were recently vaccinated, in comparison with a D614G reference virus. We utilized a new rapid neutralization assay, based on reporter cells that become positive for GFP after overnight infection. Sera from 58 convalescent individuals collected up to 9 months after symptoms, similarly neutralized B.1.1.7 and D614G. In contrast, after 9 months, convalescent sera had a mean sixfold reduction in neutralizing titers, and 40% of the samples lacked any activity against B.1.351. Sera from 19 individuals vaccinated twice with Pfizer Cominarty, longitudinally tested up to 6 weeks after vaccination, were similarly potent against B.1.1.7 but less efficacious against B.1.351, when compared to D614G. Neutralizing titers increased after the second vaccine dose, but remained 14-fold lower against B.1.351. In contrast, sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals similarly bound the three spike proteins in a flow cytometry-based serological assay. Neutralizing antibodies were rarely detected in nasal swabs from vaccinees. Thus, faster-spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants acquired a partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies generated by natural infection or vaccination, which was most frequently detected in individuals with low antibody levels. Our results indicate that B1.351, but not B.1.1.7, may increase the risk of infection in immunized individuals.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: immune_escape, sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera, binding_to_antibodies

In this study, we tested a panel of anti-receptor-binding domain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) corresponding to those in clinical use by Vir Biotechnology (S309, the parent mAb of VIR-7831 (sotrovimab)), AstraZeneca (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130, the parent mAbs of AZD8895 and AZD1061), Regeneron (REGN10933 and REGN10987), Eli Lilly (LY-CoV555 and LY-CoV016) and Celltrion (CT-P59) for their ability to neutralize an infectious B.1.1.529 Omicron isolate. Several mAbs (LY-CoV555, LY-CoV016, REGN10933, REGN10987 and CT-P59) completely lost neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529 virus in both Vero-TMPRSS2 and Vero-hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells, whereas others were reduced (COV2-2196 and COV2-2130 combination, ~12-fold decrease) or minimally affected (S309). Our results suggest that several, but not all, of the antibodies in clinical use might lose efficacy against the B.1.1.529 Omicron variant.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect_list: viral_transmission, sensitivity_to_antibodies, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs

Here, we exploit the advances of protein structure fingerprint technology to study the folding conformational changes induced by mutations. With integration of both protein sequences and folding conformations, the structures are aligned for SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, including Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) and Delta variant (lineage B.1.617.2). The results showed that the virus evolution with change in mutational positions and physicochemical properties increased the affinity between spike protein and ACE2, which plays a critical role in coronavirus entry into human cells. Additionally, these structural variations impact vaccine effectiveness and drug function over the course of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

157	10.1038/s41598-021-83761-5	Since the worldwide outbreak of the infectious disease COVID-19, several studies have been published to understand the structural mechanism of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. During the infection process, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein plays a crucial role in the receptor recognition and cell membrane fusion process by interacting with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. However, new variants of these spike proteins emerge as the virus passes through the disease reservoir. This poses a major challenge for designing a potent antigen for an effective immune response against the spike protein. Through a normal mode analysis (NMA) we identified the highly flexible region in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, starting from residue 475 up to residue 485. Structurally, the position S477 shows the highest flexibility among them. At the same time, S477 is hitherto the most frequently exchanged amino acid residue in the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Therefore, using MD simulations, we have investigated the role of S477 and its two frequent mutations (S477G and S477N) at the RBD during the binding to hACE2. We found that the amino acid exchanges S477G and S477N strengthen the binding of the SARS-COV-2 spike with the hACE2 receptor.	mutation_name: SPIKE_S477G | effect_list: binding_to_host_receptor

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor protein that interacts with the spike glycoprotein of the host to facilitate the entry of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) hence causing the disease (COVID-19). Our experimental design is based on bioinformatics approach that combines sequence, structure and consensus based tools to label a protein coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as damaging/deleterious or neutral. The interaction of wildtype ACE2-spike glycoprotein and their variants were analyzed using docking studies. The mutations W461R, G405E and F588S in ACE2 receptor protein and population specific mutations P391S, C12S and G1223A in the spike glycoprotein were predicted as highly destabilizing to the structure of the bound complex. So far, no extensive in silico study has been reported that identifies the effect of SNPs on Spike glycoprotein-ACE2 interaction exploring both sequence and structural features.

170	10.1080/07391102.2021.1944319	One major obstacle in designing a successful therapeutic regimen to combat COVID-19 pandemic is the frequent occurrence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 resulting in patient to patient variations. Out of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 namely, spike, envelope, nucleocapsid and membrane, envelope protein governs the virus pathogenicity and induction of acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. These effects are facilitated by the viroporin (ion-channel) like activities of the envelope protein. Our current work reports metagenomic analysis of envelope protein at the amino acid sequence level through mining all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID and coronapp servers. We found majority of mutations in envelope protein were localized at or near PDZ binding motif. Our analysis also demonstrates that the acquired mutations might have important implications on its structure and ion-channel activity. A statistical correlation between specific mutations (e.g. F4F, R69I, P71L, L73F) with patient mortalities were also observed, based on the patient data available for 18,691 SARS-CoV-2-genomes in the GISAID database till 30 April 2021. Albeit, whether these mutations exist as the cause or the effect of co-infections and/or co-morbid disorders within COVID-19 patients is still unclear.

Out of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 namely, spike, envelope, nucleocapsid and membrane, envelope protein governs the virus pathogenicity and induction of acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. These effects are facilitated by the viroporin (ion-channel) like activities of the envelope protein. Our current work reports metagenomic analysis of envelope protein at the amino acid sequence level through mining all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID and coronapp servers. We found majority of mutations in envelope protein were localized at or near PDZ binding motif. Our analysis also demonstrates that the acquired mutations might have important implications on its structure and ion-channel activity. A statistical correlation between specific mutations (e.g. F4F, R69I, P71L, L73F) with patient mortalities were also observed, based on the patient data available for 18,691 SARS-CoV-2-genomes in the GISAID database till 30 April 2021.

In this study, we analyzed the most predominant mutations in the S protein of Brazilian isolates and predicted the effect of these amino acid alterations to protein conformation. A total of 25,924 sequences were obtained from GISAID for five regions of Brazilian territory (Midwest, North, Northeast, South, and Southeast), according to exclusion criteria. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 isolates belongs to the G clade and showed a large occurrence of D614G, N501Y and L18F substitutions. Prediction effects of these amino acid substitutions on the structure dynamics of the spike protein indicated a positive ΔΔG values and negative ΔΔSVib in most cases which is associated to structural stabilization and flexibility reduction of the S protein. Mutations E484K, N501Y and K417N belong to several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, and showed high incidence among Brazilian isolates. These mutations have been described to increase RBD affinity to ACE-2 host and abolishment of RBD affinity to potent neutralizing ant-RBD. The increase in rates of infection and reinfection requires continuous genomic surveillance studies in order to characterize emerging mutations and monitor vaccine efficacy, and thus consideration structural data and dynamics in the observed phenotypes.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The binding of SARS CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor causes the host infection. The spike protein has undergone several mutations with reference to the initial strain isolated during December 2019 from Wuhan, China. A number of these mutant strains have been reported as variants of concern and as variants being monitored. Some of these mutants are known to be responsible for increased transmissibility of the virus. The reason for the increased transmissibility caused by the point mutations can be understood by studying the structural implications and inter-molecular interactions in the binding of viral spike protein RBD and human ACE-2. Here, we use the crystal structure of the RBD in complex with ACE-2 available in the public domain and analyse the 250 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of wild-type and mutants; K417N, K417T, N440K, N501Y, L452R, T478K, E484K and S494P.

185	10.1080/07391102.2022.2051746	Mutations drive viral evolution and genome variability that causes viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. SARS-CoV-2 has considerably higher mutation rate. SARS-CoV-2 possesses a RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which helps to replicate its genome. The mutation P323L in RdRp is associated with the loss of a particular epitope (321-327) from this protein. We consider the effects of mutations in some of the epitope region including the naturally occurring mutation P323L on the structure of the epitope and their interface with paratope using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. We observe that the mutations cause conformational changes in the epitope region by opening up the region associated with increase in the radius of gyration and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, making the region less accessible. Moreover, we study the conformational stability of the epitope region and epitope:paratope interface under the mutation from the fluctuations in the dihedral angles. We observe that the mutation renders the epitope and the epitope:paratope interface unstable compared to the corresponding wild type ones. Thus, the mutations may help in escaping antibody mediated immunity of the hostCommunicated by Ramaswamy H.

186	10.1093/cid/ciab721	BACKGROUND: he impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) on disease severity is unclear. In this retrospective study, we compared outcomes of patients infected with B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 with those with wild-type strains from early 2020. METHODS: National surveillance data from 1-January-2021 to 22-May-2021 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, and outcomes in relation to VOC were explored. Detailed patient level data from all patients with VOC infection admitted to our center between 20-December-2020 and 12-May-2021 were analyzed. Clinical outcomes were compared with a cohort of 846 patients admitted from January-April 2020. RESULTS: 829 patients in Singapore in the study period were infected with these 3 VOCs. After adjusting for age and sex, B.1.617.2 was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or death (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4.90, [95% CI 1.43-30.78]). 157 of these patients were admitted to our center. After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and vaccination, aOR for pneumonia with B.1.617.2 was 1.88 [95% CI 0.95-3.76]) compared with wild-type. These differences were not seen with B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Vaccination status was associated with decreased severity. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and longer duration of Ct value ≤30 (median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2, 13 days for wild-type). CONCLUSIONS: There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility. These findings provide an impetus for the rapid implementation of vaccination programs.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect_list: disease_severity, fatality_rate, ct_value, viral_transmission

Clinically, Delta variant infection have been observed/documented in convalescent patients/vaccinees, although with less incidence of severe diseases, but can serve as reservoir to spread the infection to the unvaccinated.

189	10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac049	Worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts track emerging mutations in its spike protein, as well as characteristic mutations in other viral proteins. Besides their epidemiological importance, the observed SARS-CoV-2 sequences present an ensemble of viable protein variants, and thereby a source of information on viral protein structure and function. Charting the mutational landscape of the nucleocapsid (N) protein that facilitates viral assembly, we observe variability exceeding that of the spike protein, with more than 86% of residues that can be substituted, on average by three to four different amino acids. However, mutations exhibit an uneven distribution that tracks known structural features but also reveals highly protected stretches of unknown function. One of these conserved regions is in the central disordered linker proximal to the N-G215C mutation that has become dominant in the Delta variant, outcompeting G215 variants without further spike or N-protein substitutions. Structural models suggest that the G215C mutation stabilizes conserved transient helices in the disordered linker serving as protein-protein interaction interfaces. Comparing Delta variant N-protein to its ancestral version in biophysical experiments, we find a significantly more compact and less disordered structure. N-G215C exhibits substantially stronger self-association, shifting the unliganded protein from a dimeric to a tetrameric oligomeric state, which leads to enhanced coassembly with nucleic acids. This suggests that the sequence variability of N-protein is mirrored by high plasticity of N-protein biophysical properties, which we hypothesize can be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to achieve greater efficiency of viral assembly, and thereby enhanced infectivity.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: protein_conformational_optimization

To predict the impact of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions identified in ORF3a on the formation of B-cell epitopes and their role in evading the immune response, nucleotide and protein sequences of 537 available SARS-CoV-2 genomes were analyzed for the presence of non-synonymous mutations and polyproline regions. Mutations were correlated with changes in epitope formation. A total of 19 different non-synonymous amino acids substitutions were detected in ORF3a among 537 SARS-CoV-2 strains. G251V was the most common and identified in 9.9% (n=53) of the strains and was predicted to lead to the loss of a B-cell like epitope in ORF3a. Polyproline regions were detected in two strains (EPI_ISL_410486, France and EPI_ISL_407079, Finland) and affected epitopes formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations and detected polyproline regions in ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 could be driving the evasion of the host immune response thus favoring viral spread. Rapid mutations accumulating in ORF3a should be closely monitored throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Importance At the surge of the COVID-19 pandemic and after three months of the identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the disease-causing pathogen, nucleic acid changes due to host-pathogen interactions are insightful into the evolution of this virus. In this paper, we have identified a set of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a and predicted their impact on B-cell like epitope formation. The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in ORF3a could be driving protein changes that mediate immune evasion and favoring viral spread.	mutation_name: ORF3A_G251V | effect_list: protein_functioning
192	10.1101/2020.06.14.151357	A novel isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis to introduce the D614G variant and show that in multiple cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, that the D614G mutation is up to 8-fold more effective at transducing cells than wild-type. We demonstrate increased infection using both Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus and intact SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the Spike variants, we show that the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage in vitro and in human cells, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction. This result has important implications for the efficacy of Spike-based vaccines currently under development in protecting against this recent and highly-prevalent SARS-CoV-2 isolate.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: infectivity, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, viral_transmission
193	10.1101/2020.07.04.187757	Virus genome sequence variants that appear over the course of an outbreak can be exploited to map the trajectory of the virus from one susceptible host to another. While such variants are usually of no functional significance, in some cases they may allow the virus to transmit faster, change disease severity, or confer resistance to antiviral therapies. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 as the cause of COVID-19, the virus has spread around the globe, and thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced. The rate of sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 isolates is modest for an RNA virus but the enormous number of human-to-human transmission events has provided abundant opportunity for selection of sequence variants. Among these, the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variant, D614G, was not present in the presumptive common ancestor of this zoonotic virus but was first detected in late January in Germany and China. The D614G variant steadily increased in frequency and now constitutes >97% of isolates world-wide, raising the question whether D614G confers a replication advantage to SARS-CoV-2. Structural models predict that D614G would disrupt contacts between the S1 and S2 domains of the Spike protein and cause significant shifts in conformation. Using single-cycle vectors we showed that D614G is three to nine-fold more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung and colon cell lines, as well as on other human cell lines rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 and TMPRSS2, or by ACE2 orthologues from pangolin, pig, dog, or cat. Nonetheless, monoclonal antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein retain full neutralization potency. These results suggest that D614G was selected for increased human-to-human transmission, that it contributed to the rapidity of SARS-CoV-2 spread around the world, and that it does not confer resistance to antiviral therapies targeting the receptor binding domain.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: protein_conformational_optimization, infectivity, sensitivity_to_antibodies, viral_transmission, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs, viral_replication
194	10.1101/2020.07.22.20159905	The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein acquired a D614G mutation early in the COVID-19 pandemic that appears to confer on the virus greater infectivity and now globally is the dominant form of the virus. Certain of the current vaccines entering phase 3 trials are based on the early D614 form of Spike with the goal of eliciting protective neutralizing antibodies. To determine whether D614G mediates neutralization-escape that could compromise vaccine efficacy, sera from Spike-immunized mice, nonhuman primates and humans were evaluated for neutralization of pseudoviruses bearing either D614 or G614 Spike on their surface. In all cases, G614 Spike pseudovirions were moderately more susceptible to neutralization, indicating this is not an escape mutation that would impede current vaccines. Rather, the gain in infectivity provided by D614G came at the cost of making the virus more vulnerable to neutralizing antibodies.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: infectivity, immune_escape

We investigated the distribution of inter-host single nucleotide polymorphisms (inter-host SNPs) and intra-host single nucleotide variations (iSNVs). Mutations have been observed at 35.6% (10,649/29,903) of the bases in the genome. The substitution rate in some protein coding regions is higher than the average in SARS-CoV-2 viruses, and the high substitution rate in some regions might be driven to escape immune recognition by diversifying selection.

198	10.1101/2020.09.01.278689	A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an “up” conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: viral_transmission, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, viral_replication, infectivity, viral_load, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs
199	10.1101/2020.11.21.392407	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been undergoing various mutations. The analysis of the structural and energetic effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will be beneficial for epidemic surveillance, diagnosis, and optimization of neutralizing agents. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, a key mutation N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region created a new salt bridge which resulted in greater electrostatic complementarity. Furthermore, the N439K-mutated RBD bound hACE2 with a higher affinity than wild-type, which may lead to more infectious. In addition, the N439K-mutated RBD was markedly resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody REGN10987, which may lead to the failure of neutralization. These findings would offer guidance on the development of neutralizing antibodies and the prevention of COVID-19.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N439K | effect_list: intermolecular_interactions, binding_to_host_receptor, infectivity, sensitivity_to_antibodies
200	10.1101/2020.12.19.423600	Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in ≥0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in ≥0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.	mutation_name: NSP12_P323L | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs
201	10.1101/2021.01.04.425316	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an ongoing global pandemic for over a year. Recently, an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.7) with an unusually large number of mutations had become highly contagious and wide-spreading in United Kingdom. From genome analysis, the N501Y mutation within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein might have enhanced the viral protein’s binding with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The latter is the prelude for the virus’ entry into host cells. So far, the molecular mechanism of this enhanced binding is still elusive, which prevents us from assessing its effects on existing therapeutic antibodies. Using all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that Y501 in mutated RBD can be well coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, increasing the overall binding affinity between RBD and hACE2 by about 0.81 kcal/mol. We further explored how the N501Y mutation might affect the binding between a neutralizing antibody (CB6) and RBD. We expect that our work can help researchers design proper measures responding to this urgent virus mutation, such as adding a modified/new neutralizing antibody specifically targeting at this variant in the therapeutic antibody cocktail.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission, infectivity

203	10.1101/2021.01.18.426984	Recently, a new SARS-CoV-2 lineage called B.1.1.7 has emerged in the United Kingdom that was reported to spread more efficiently than other strains. This variant has an unusually large number of mutations with 10 amino acid changes in the spike protein, raising concerns that its recognition by neutralizing antibodies may be affected. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2-S pseudoviruses bearing either the Wuhan reference strain or the B.1.1.7 lineage spike protein with sera of 16 participants in a previously reported trial with the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2. The immune sera had equivalent neutralizing titers to both variants. These data, together with the combined immunity involving humoral and cellular effectors induced by this vaccine, make it unlikely that the B.1.1.7 lineage will escape BNT162b2-mediated protection.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera

The propagation of new lineages and the discovery of key mechanisms adopted by the virus to overlap the immune system are central topics for the entire public health policies, research and disease management. Since the second semester of 2020, the mutation E484K has been progressively found in the Brazilian territory, composing different lineages over time. It brought multiple concerns related to the risk of reinfection and the effectiveness of new preventive and treatment strategies due to the possibility of escaping from neutralizing antibodies. To better characterize the current scenario we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of the E484K mutated genomes sequenced from Brazilian samples in 2020. From October, 2020, more than 40% of the sequenced genomes present the E484K mutation, which was identified in three different lineages (P1, P2 and B.1.1.33) in four Brazilian regions. We also evaluated the presence of E484K associated mutations and identified selective pressures acting on the spike protein, leading us to some insights about adaptive and purifying selection driving the virus evolution.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect_list: immune_escape, risk_of_reinfection

All current vaccines are based on the ancestral Spike with the goal of generating a protective neutralizing antibody response. Several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple Spike mutations have emerged, and their rapid spread and potential for immune escape have raised concerns. One of these variants, first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.1.7 (also called VUI202012/01), contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy, vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we employed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus assay to show that variant B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization, albeit at moderately reduced levels (~2-fold), by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of two different vaccines based on ancestral Spike: mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax). Some monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike were less effective against the variant while others were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that B.1.1.7 is not a neutralization escape variant that would be a major concern for current vaccines, or for an increased risk of reinfection.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_antibodies, sensitivity_to_antibodies, sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera, risk_of_reinfection, immune_escape

213	10.1101/2021.02.06.21251159	As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission

We developed the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detected an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020 when it represented <1% of sequenced coronavirus genomes that were collected in New York City (NYC). By February 2021, genomes from this lineage accounted for ~32% of 3288 sequenced genomes from NYC specimens. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage in NYC, notably the sub-clade defined by the spike mutation E484K, which has outpaced the growth of other variants in NYC. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, indicating the public health importance of this lineage.	mutation_name: B.1.526 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera, viral_transmission

Here we demonstrated by cryo-electron microscopy that the D614G mutation does not significantly perturb the structure of the spike protein, but multiple receptor binding domains are in an upward conformation poised for host receptor binding. The impact of the mutation lies in its ability to eliminate the unusual cold-induced unfolding characteristics, and to significantly increase the thermal stability under physiological pH.

228	10.1101/2021.05.03.441080	A new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has started as several SARS-CoV-2 variants are rapidly emerging globally, raising concerns for increased transmissibility. As animal models and traditional in vitro systems may fail to model key aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle, representative in vitro systems to assess variants phenotypically are urgently needed. We found that the British variant (clade B.1.1.7), compared to an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 clade B virus, produced higher levels of infectious virus late in infection and had a higher replicative fitness in human airway, alveolar and intestinal organoid models. Our findings unveil human organoids as powerful tools to phenotype viral variants and suggest extended shedding as a correlate of fitness for SARS-CoV-2.

229	10.1101/2021.05.07.21256341	The relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and infectiousness is not known. Using data from a prospective cohort of index cases and high-risk contact, we reconstructed by modelling the viral load at the time of contact and the probability of infection. The effect of viral load was particularly large in household contacts, with a transmission probability that increased to as much as 37% when the viral load was greater than 10 log 10 copies per mL. The transmission probability peaked at symptom onset in most individuals, with a median probability of transmission of 15%, that hindered large individual variations (IQR: [8, 37]). The model also projects the effects of variants on disease transmission. Based on the current knowledge that viral load is increased by 2 to 4-fold on average, we estimate that infection with B1.1.7 virus could lead to an increase in the probability of transmission by 8 to 17%.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_load, viral_transmission
230	10.1101/2021.06.04.21258333	In early 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 became dominant across large parts of the world. In Denmark, comprehensive and real-time test, contact-tracing, and sequencing efforts were applied to sustain epidemic control. Here, we use these data to investigate the transmissibility, introduction, and onward transmission of B.1.1.7 in Denmark. In a period with stable restrictions, we estimated an increased B.1.1.7 transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%,60%]) relative to other lineages. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that 37% of B.1.1.7 cases were related to the initial introduction in November 2020. Continuous introductions contributed substantially to case numbers, highlighting the benefit of balanced travel restrictions and self-isolation procedures coupled with comprehensive surveillance efforts, to sustain epidemic control in the face of emerging variants.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission

The underlying mechanisms behind their transmission advantage remain unclear. We measured viral load in 950 individuals and found that infections with variant Alpha exhibit a higher viral load and longer viral shedding compared to non-VOC. We then used a transmission model to analyze the spread of variant Alpha in Geneva, Switzerland, and variant Beta in South Africa. We estimated that Alpha is either associated with a 37% (95% compatibility interval, CI: 25-63%) increase in transmissibility or a 51% (95% CI: 32-80%) increase of the infectious duration, or a combination of the two mechanisms. Assuming 50% immune evasion for Beta, we estimated a 23% (95% CI: 10-37%) increase in transmissibility or a 38% (95% CI: 15-78%) increase of the infectious duration for this variant. Beta is expected to outgrow Alpha in regions where the level of naturally acquired immunity from previously circulating variants exceeds 20% to 40%. Close monitoring of Alpha and Beta in regions with different levels of immunity will help to anticipate the global spread of these and future variants.	mutation_name: ALPHA | effect_list: viral_load, viral_transmission, viral_incubation_period

233	10.1101/2021.06.16.21259017	Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean, has had a unique experience of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In March 2020, Mauritius endured a small first wave and quickly implemented control measures which allowed elimination of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. When borders to the island reopened, it was accompanied by mandatory quarantine and testing of incoming passengers to avoid reintroduction of the virus into the community. As variants of concern (VOCs) emerged elsewhere in the world, Mauritius began using genomic surveillance to keep track of quarantined cases of these variants. In March 2021, another local outbreak occurred, and sequencing was used to investigate this new wave of local infections. Here, we analyze 154 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Mauritius, which represent 12% of all the infections seem in Mauritius, these were both from specimens of incoming passengers before March 2021 and those of cases during the second wave. Our findings indicate that despite the presence of known VOCs Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) among quarantined passengers, the second wave of local SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mauritius was caused by a single introduction and dominant circulation of the B.1.1.318 virus. The B.1.1.318 variant is characterized by fourteen non-synonymous mutations in the S-gene, with five encoded amino acid substitutions (T95I, E484K, D614G, P681H, D796H) and one deletion (Y144del) in the Spike glycoprotein. This variant seems to be increasing in prevalence and it is now present in 34 countries. This study highlights that despite having stopped the introduction of more transmissible VOCs by travel quarantines, a single undetected introduction of a B.1.1.318 lineage virus was enough to initiate a large local outbreak in Mauritius and demonstrated the need for continuous genomic surveillance to fully inform public health decisions.	mutation_name: B.1.1.318 | effect_list: viral_transmission
234	10.1101/2021.07.26.453518	Airborne transmission, a term combining both large droplet and aerosol transmission, is thought to be the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission

Efforts to determine why these viral variants have improved fitness are limited to mutations in the viral spike (S) protein and viral entry steps using non-SARS-CoV-2 viral particles engineered to display S. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and rapid dissection of multiple steps in the viral life cycle. Identification of an RNA packaging sequence was critical for engineered transcripts to assemble together with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) into non-replicative SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) that deliver these transcripts to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells. Using SC2-VLPs, we tested the effect of 30 individual mutations within the S and N proteins on particle assembly and entry. While S mutations unexpectedly did not affect these steps, SC2-VLPs bearing any one of four N mutations found universally in more-transmissible viral variants (P199L, S202R, R203M and R203K) showed increased particle production and up to 10-fold more reporter transcript expression in receiver cells.

While S mutations unexpectedly did not affect these steps, SC2-VLPs bearing any one of four N mutations found universally in more-transmissible viral variants (P199L, S202R, R203M and R203K) showed increased particle production and up to 10-fold more reporter transcript expression in receiver cells. Our study provides a platform for rapid testing of viral variants outside a biosafety level 3 setting and identifies viral N mutations and viral particle assembly as mechanisms to explain the increased spread of current viral variants, including Delta (N:R203M). One-Sentence Summary R203M substitution within SARS-CoV-2 N, found in delta variant, improves RNA packaging into virus-like particles by 10-fold.	mutation_name: N_R203M | effect_list: viral_transmission, protein_functioning
239	10.1101/2021.08.05.455082	Newly evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants are driving ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 around the world. Efforts to determine why these viral variants have improved fitness are limited to mutations in the viral spike (S) protein and viral entry steps using non-SARS-CoV-2 viral particles engineered to display S. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and rapid dissection of multiple steps in the viral life cycle.

240	10.1101/2021.08.12.21261991	Background: The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 has become predominant globally. We evaluated the transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the Delta variant in an outbreak in southern China. Methods: Data on confirmed cases and their close contacts were retrospectively collected from the outbreak that occurred in Guangdong, China in May-June 2021. Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated and compared between the Delta variant and the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. Results: We identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. The mean estimates of the latent period and the incubation period were 4.0 days and 5.8 days, respectively. A relatively higher viral load was observed in Delta cases than in wild-type infections. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of Delta cases was 1.4%, and 73.9% (95% confidence interval: 67.2%, 81.3%) of the transmissions occurred before onset. Index cases without vaccination (OR: 2.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 8.45) or with one dose of vaccination (OR: 6.02, 95% confidence interval: 2.45, 18.16) were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received 2 doses of vaccination. Discussion: Patients infected with the Delta variant had more rapid symptom onset. The shorter and time-varying serial interval should be accounted in estimation of reproductive numbers. The higher viral load and higher risk of pre-symptomatic transmission indicated the challenges in control of infections with the Delta variant.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: viral_load, viral_transmission, viral_incubation_period, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines
241	10.1101/2021.08.12.456173	SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has rapidly replaced the Alpha variant around the world. The mechanism that drives this global replacement has not been defined. Here we report that Delta spike mutation P681R plays a key role in the Alpha-to-Delta variant replacement. In a replication competition assay, Delta SARS-CoV-2 efficiently outcompeted the Alpha variant in human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues. Delta SARS-CoV-2 bearing the Alpha-spike glycoprotein replicated less efficiently than the wild-type Delta variant, suggesting the importance of Delta spike in enhancing viral replication. The Delta spike has accumulated mutation P681R located at a furin cleavage site that separates the spike 1 (S1) and S2 subunits. Reverting the P681R mutation to wild-type P681 significantly reduced the replication of Delta variant, to a level lower than the Alpha variant. Mechanistically, the Delta P681R mutation enhanced the cleavage of the full-length spike to S1 and S2, leading to increased infection via cell surface entry. In contrast, the Alpha spike also has a mutation at the same amino acid (P681H), but the spike cleavage from purified Alpha virions was reduced compared to the Delta spike. Collectively, our results indicate P681R as a key mutation in enhancing Delta variant replication via increased S1/S2 cleavage. Spike mutations that potentially affect furin cleavage efficiency must be closely monitored for future variant surveillance.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: viral_replication, viral_fitness

244	10.1101/2021.08.14.21262020	Background: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2), initially identified in India, has become predominant in several countries, including Portugal. Few studies have compared the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against Delta versus Alpha variant of concern (VOC) and estimated variant-specific viral loads in vaccine infection breakthroughs cases. In the context of Delta dominance, this information is critical to inform decision-makers regarding the planning of restrictions and vaccination roll-out. Methods: We developed a case-case study to compare mRNA vaccines' effectiveness against Delta (B.1.617.2) versus Alpha (B.1.1.7) variants. We used RT-PCR positive cases notified to the National Surveillance System between 17th of May and 4th of July 2021 (week 20 to 26) and information about demographics and vaccination status through the electronic vaccination register. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or spike (S) gene target failure (SGTF) data were used to classify SARS-CoV-2 variants. The odds of vaccinated individuals to become infected (odds of vaccine infection breakthrough) in Delta cases compared to Alpha SARS-CoV-2 cases was estimated by conditional logistic regression adjusted for age group, sex, and matched by the week of diagnosis. As a surrogate of viral load, mean RT-PCR Ct values were stratified and compared between vaccine status and VOC. Results: Of the 2 097 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive cases included in the analysis, 966 (46.1%) were classified with WGS and 1131 (53.9%) with SGTF. Individuals infected with the Delta variant were more frequently vaccinated 162 (12%) than individuals infected with the Alpha variant 38 (5%). We report a statistically significant higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough for partial (OR=1.70; CI95% 1.18 to 2.47) and complete vaccination (OR=1.96; CI95% 1.22 to 3.14) in the Delta cases when compared to the Alpha cases, suggesting lower mRNA vaccine effectiveness against Delta cases. On our secondary analysis, we observed lower mean Ct values for the Delta VOC cases versus Alpha, regardless the vaccination status. Additionally, the Delta variant cases revealed a Ct-value mean increase of 2.24 (CI95% 0.85 to 3.64) between unvaccinated and fully vaccinated breakthrough cases contrasting with 4.49 (CI95% 2.07 to 6.91) in the Alpha VOC, suggesting a lower impact of vaccine on viral load of Delta cases. Conclusions: We found significantly higher odds of vaccine infection breakthrough in Delta cases when compared to Alpha cases, suggesting lower effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in preventing infection with the Delta variant. Additionally, the vaccine breakthrough cases are estimated to be of higher mean Ct values, suggesting higher infectiousness with the Delta variant infection. These findings can help decision-makers weigh on the application or lifting of control measures and adjusting vaccine roll-out depending on the predominance of the Delta variant and the coverage of partial and complete mRNA vaccination.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect_list: ct_value, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, infectivity
245	10.1101/2021.08.17.21260128	Background The Alpha (B.1.1.7) SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern has been associated with increased transmission and increased 28-day mortality. We aimed to investigate the impact of infection on clinical severity of illness, including the need for oxygen or ventilation in a national cohort study. Methods In this prospective clinical cohort study, 1475 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were obtained from patients infected in Scotland, UK between the 1st November 2020 and 30th January 2021 and matched to clinical outcomes as the lineage became dominant in Scotland. We modelled the association between B.1.1.7 infection and severe disease using a cumulative generalised linear mixed model employing a 4-point scale of maximum severity based on requirement of respiratory support at 28 days. We also estimated the growth rate of B.1.1.7-associated infections as it emerged in Scotland using a phylogenetic exponential growth rate population model. Results The B.1.1.7 lineage was responsible for a third wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Scotland in association with a transmission rate 5-fold higher than the preceding second wave B.1.177 lineage. Of 1475 patients, 364 were infected with B.1.1.7, 1030 with B.1.177 and 81 with other lineages. Our analysis found a positive association between increased clinical severity and lineage (B.1.1.7 versus non-B.1.1.7; cumulative odds ratio: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.93). Viral load was higher in B.1.1.7 samples than in non-B.1.1.7 samples, as measured by cycle threshold (Ct) value (mean Ct change: -2.46, 95% CI: -4.22, -0.70). Conclusions The B.1.1.7 lineage was associated with more severe clinical disease in Scottish patients than co-circulating lineages.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission, fatality_rate, disease_severity, viral_load, ct_value

A range of 2-22 mutations were observed including D614G, L452R, Q613H, Q677H, T1027I in S gene, S194L in N gene, Q57H, L106F, T175I in ORF3a gene as reported previously and also possible novel mutations like P309S in ORF1ab gene, T379I in N gene and L52F, V77I in ORF3a gene were detected.Phylogenetic genome analysis has shown similarity with other SARS-CoV-2 viruses reported in Uttar Pradesh. Mutations in these genes have the potential to affect the severity of the disease. Therefore, identify the mutation is very important to know the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 virus.	mutation_name: SPIKE_T1027I | effect_list: disease_severity

Whether COVID19 from Delta infection differs to infection with other variants in children is unknown. Methods Through the prospective COVID Symptom Study, 109,626 UK school-aged children were proxy-reported between December 28, 2020 and July 8, 2021. We selected all symptomatic children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were proxy-reported at least weekly, within two timeframes: December 28, 2020 to May 6, 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) the main UK circulating variant); and May 26 to July 8, 2021 (Delta the main UK circulating variant). We assessed illness profiles (symptom prevalence, duration, and burden), hospital presentation, and presence of long (>28 day) illness; and calculated odds ratios for symptoms presenting within the first 28 days of illness. Findings 694 (276 younger [5 11 years], 418 older [12 17 years]) symptomatic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with Alpha infection and 706 (227 younger and 479 older) children with Delta infection. Median illness duration was short with either variant (overall cohort: 5 days (IQR 2 9.75) with Alpha, 5 days (IQR 2 9) with Delta). The seven most prevalent symptoms were common to both variants. Symptom burden over the first 28 days was slightly greater with Delta compared with Alpha infection (in younger children, 3 (IQR 2 5) with Alpha, 4 (IQR 2 7) with Delta; in older children 5 (IQR 3 8) with Alpha and 6 (IQR 3 9) with Delta infection in older children). The odds of several symptoms were higher with Delta than Alpha infection, including headache and fever. Few children presented to hospital, and long illness duration was uncommon, with either variant. Interpretation COVID-19 in UK school-aged children due to SARSCoV2 Delta strain B.1.617.2 resembles illness due to the Alpha variant B.1.1.7., with short duration and similar symptom burden.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: infection_duration

264	10.1101/2021.11.18.469065	SARS-CoV-2 has considerably higher mutation rate. SARS-CoV-2 possesses a RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which helps to replicate its genome. The mutation P323L in RdRp is associated with the loss of a particular epitope (321-327) from this protein which may influence the pathogenesis of the concern SARS-CoV-2 through the development of antibody escape variants. We consider the effect of mutations in some of the epitope regions including the naturally occurring mutation P323L on the structure of the epitope and their interface with paratope using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. P323L mutations cause conformational changes in the epitope region by opening up the region associated with increase in the radius of gyration and intramolecular hydrogen bonds, making the region less accessible. Moreover, the fluctuations in the dihedral angles in the epitope:paratope (IgG) interface increase which destabilize the interface. Such mutations may help in escaping antibody mediated immunity of the host.	mutation_name: NSP12_P323L | effect_list: protein_functioning, protein_conformational_optimization, immune_escape, protein_stability

Methods This prospective observational cohort study assessed symptomatic adults participating in the app-based COVID Symptom Study who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from May 26 to July 1, 2021 (Delta overwhelmingly predominant circulating UK variant), compared (1:1, age- and sex-matched) with individuals presenting from December 28, 2020 to May 6, 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) predominant variant). We assessed illness (symptoms, duration, presentation to hospital) during Alpha- and Delta-predominant timeframes; and transmission, reinfection, and vaccine effectiveness during the Delta-predominant period. Findings 3,581 individuals (aged 18 to 100 years) from each timeframe were assessed. The seven most frequent symptoms were common to both variants. Within the first 28 days of illness, some symptoms were more common with Delta vs. Alpha infection (including fever, sore throat and headache) and vice versa (dyspnoea). Symptom burden in the first week was higher with Delta vs. Alpha infection; however, the odds of any given symptom lasting [≥]7 days was either lower or unchanged. Illness duration [≥]28 days was lower with Delta vs. Alpha infection, though unchanged in unvaccinated individuals. Hospitalisation for COVID-19 was unchanged. The Delta variant appeared more (1.47) transmissible than Alpha. Re-infections were low in all UK regions. Vaccination markedly (69-84%) reduced risk of Delta infection.

267	10.1101/2021.12.06.471377	SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein to the peptidase domain (PD) of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in host cells. Recently detected Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B.1.1.529) is heavily mutated on RBD. Currently, the most common Omicron variants are the original BA.1 Omicron strain and the BA.2 variant, which became more prevalent since it first appeared. To investigate how these mutations affect RBD-PD interactions, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the BA.1 and BA.2 RBD-PD in the presence of full-length glycans, explicit water and ions. Simulations revealed that RBDs of BA.1 and BA.2 variants exhibit a more dispersed interaction network and make an increased number of salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions with PD compared to wild-type RBD. Although BA.1 and BA.2 differ in two residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface, no major difference in RBD-PD interactions and binding strengths were observed between these variants. Using the conformations sampled in each trajectory, the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method estimated ~34% and ~51% stronger binding free energies for BA.1 and BA.2 RBD, respectively, than wild-type RBD, which may result in higher binding efficiency of the Omicron variant to infect host cells.	mutation_name: BA.1 | effect_list: protein_conformational_optimization, binding_to_host_receptor, entry_efficiency

269	10.1101/2021.12.07.21267431	In 2021, Delta has become the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant worldwide. While vaccines effectively prevent COVID-19 hospitalization and death, vaccine breakthrough infections increasingly occur. The precise role of clinical and genomic determinants in Delta infections is not known, and whether they contribute to increased rates of breakthrough infections compared to unvaccinated controls. Here, we show a steep and near complete replacement of circulating variants with Delta between May and August 2021 in metropolitan New York. We observed an increase of the Delta sublineage AY.25, its spike mutation S112L, and nsp12 mutation F192V in breakthroughs. Delta infections were associated with younger age and lower hospitalization rates than Alpha. Delta breakthroughs increased significantly with time since vaccination, and, after adjusting for confounders, they rose at similar rates as in unvaccinated individuals. Our data indicate a limited impact of vaccine escape in favor of Delta’s increased epidemic growth in times of waning vaccine protection.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: risk_of_hospitalization, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines
270	10.1101/2021.12.14.472704	The recent emergence of the omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with large numbers of mutations has raised concern about a potential new surge in infections. Here we use molecular dynamics to study the biophysics of the interface of the omicron spike protein binding to (i) the ACE2 receptor protein, (ii) antibodies from all known binding regions, and (iii) the furin binding domain. Our simulations suggest that while there is significant reduction of antibody binding strength corresponding to escape, the omicron spike pays a cost in terms of weaker receptor binding. The furin cleavage domain is the same or weaker binding than the alpha variant, suggesting less viral load and disease intensity than the extant delta variant.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: binding_to_antibodies, immune_escape, viral_load, disease_severity

Further, we provide a comparative analysis of the mutational effects within variant spikes and identify the structural role of mutations within the NTD and RBD in evading antibody neutralization. Our analysis shows that the highly mutated Gamma N-terminal domain exhibits considerable structural rearrangements, partially explaining its decreased neutralization by convalescent sera. Our results provide mechanistic insights into the structural, functional, and antigenic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike mutations and highlight a spike protein vulnerability that may be exploited to achieve broad protection against circulating variants.	mutation_name: GAMMA | effect_list: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, protein_conformational_optimization
272	10.1101/2021.12.24.474086	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs) has exacerbated the COVID-19 pandemic. End of November 2021, a new SARS-CoV-2 variant namely the omicron (B.1.1.529) emerged. Since this omicron variant is heavily mutated in the spike protein, WHO classified this variant as the 5th variant of concern (VoC). We previously demonstrated that the other SARS-CoV-2 VoCs replicate efficiently in Syrian hamsters, alike also the ancestral strains. We here wanted to explore the infectivity of the omicron variant in comparison to the ancestral D614G strain. Strikingly, in hamsters that had been infected with the omicron variant, a 3 log10 lower viral RNA load was detected in the lungs as compared to animals infected with D614G and no infectious virus was detectable in this organ. Moreover, histopathological examination of the lungs from omicron-infecetd hamsters revealed no signs of peri-bronchial inflammation or bronchopneumonia. Further experiments are needed to determine whether the omicron VoC replicates possibly more efficiently in the upper respiratory tract of hamsters than in their lungs.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect_list: viral_load, disease_severity, viral_replication
273	10.1101/2021.12.27.474273	The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become the dominant infective strain and the focus efforts against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here we report an extensive set of structures of the Omicron spike trimer by its own or in complex with ACE2 and an anti-Omicron antibody. These structures reveal that most Omicron mutations are located on the surface of the spike protein, which confer stronger ACE2 binding by nearly 10 folds but become inactive epitopes resistant to many therapeutic antibodies. Importantly, both RBD and the closed conformation of the Omicron spike trimer are thermodynamically unstable, with the melting temperature of the Omicron RBD decreased by as much as 7°C, making the spiker trimer prone to random open conformations. An unusual RBD-RBD interaction in the ACE2-spike complex unique to Omicron is observed to support the open conformation and ACE2 binding, serving the basis for the higher infectivity of Omicron. A broad-spectrum therapeutic antibody JMB2002, which has completed Phase 1 clinical trial, is found to interact with the same two RBDs to inhibit ACE2 binding, in a mode that is distinguished from all previous antibodies, thus providing the structural basis for the potent inhibition of Omicron by this antibody. Together with biochemical data, our structures provide crucial insights into higher infectivity, antibody evasion and inhibition of Omicron.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: binding_to_host_receptor, protein_functioning, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs, protein_stability, intermolecular_interactions, infectivity, immune_escape

The in vivo pathogenicity, transmissibility, and fitness of this new Variant of Concerns are unknown. We investigated these virological attributes of the Omicron variant in comparison with those of the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in the golden Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron-infected hamsters developed significantly less body weight losses, clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine/chemokine dysregulation, and tissue damages than Delta-infected hamsters. The Omicron and Delta variant were both highly transmissible (100% vs 100%) via contact transmission. Importantly, the Omicron variant consistently demonstrated about 10-20% higher transmissibility than the already-highly transmissible Delta variant in repeated non-contact transmission studies (overall: 30/36 vs 24/36, 83.3% vs 66.7%). The Delta variant displayed higher fitness advantage than the Omicron variant without selection pressure in both in vitro and in vivo competition models. However, this scenario drastically changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies active against the Delta variant but poorly active against the Omicron variant were introduced, with the Omicron variant significantly outcompeting the Delta variant. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that while the Omicron variant is less pathogenic than the Delta variant, it is highly transmissible and can outcompete the Delta variant under immune selection pressure.

278	10.1101/2022.01.13.22269234	The aim of the present paper is to highlight that new variants, either of higher viral load such as delta or higher contagiousness like omicron, lead to an even higher airborne transmission than historical strains. We first review the question of the route of contamination and of the dose following exposure, and the importance of the counting unit for pathogens, itself linked to the dose-response law. Using the counting unit of Wells, i.e. the quantum of contagium, we develop the conservation equation of quanta which allows deriving the value of the quantum concentration at steady state for a well-mixed room. With the choice of an exponential response function, this leads to the famous Wells-Riley equation. The analysis points out the importance of a number of parameters such as the time of exposure, the quantum production rate, mask wearing and the incidence rate in the population in order to evaluate the risk. The link with the monitoring concentration of carbon dioxide is made and used for a risk analysis of a variety of situations for which we have made concrete CO2 time monitoring. The main conclusion of these observations is that the present norms of ventilation, already insufficient, are not respected, especially in a variety of public premises, leading to high risk of contamination.

We first review the question of the route of contamination and of the dose following exposure, and the importance of the counting unit for pathogens, itself linked to the dose-response law. Using the counting unit of Wells, i.e. the quantum of contagium, we develop the conservation equation of quanta which allows deriving the value of the quantum concentration at steady state for a well-mixed room. With the choice of an exponential response function, this leads to the famous Wells-Riley equation. The analysis points out the importance of a number of parameters such as the time of exposure, the quantum production rate, mask wearing and the incidence rate in the population in order to evaluate the risk. The link with the monitoring concentration of carbon dioxide is made and used for a risk analysis of a variety of situations for which we have made concrete CO2 time monitoring. The main conclusion of these observations is that the present norms of ventilation, already insufficient, are not respected, especially in a variety of public premises, leading to high risk of contamination. Finally, we insist that public health policy in the field of airborne transmission should be based on a multi parameter analysis, considering the whole complexity of dose evaluation.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: infectivity, viral_transmission
280	10.1101/2022.01.20.477163	The amino acid (AA) mutations that characterise the different variants of concern (VOCs), which replaced the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate worldwide, provide biological advantages such as increased infectivity and partial escape from humoral immunity. Here we analysed the impact of these mutations on vaccination- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells. We confirmed that, in the majority of infected or vaccinated individuals, different mutations present in a single VOC (Delta) or a combined mosaic of more than 30 AA substitutions and deletions found in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron VOCs cause modest alteration in the global Spike-specific T cell response. However, distinct numerically dominant Spike-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells preferentially targeted regions affected by AA mutations and do not recognise the mutated peptides. Importantly, some of these mutations, such as N501Y (present in Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Omicron) and L452R (present in Delta), known to provide biological advantage to SARS-CoV-2 in terms of infectivity also abolished CD8 T cell recognition. Taken together, our data show that while global mRNA vaccine- and infection-induced Spike-specific T cells largely tolerate the diverse mutations present in VOCs, single Spike-specific T cells might contribute to the natural selection of SARS-CoV-2 variants.	mutation_name: ALPHA | effect_list: immune_escape

287	10.1101/2022.01.31.22270206	The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of rapid antigen tests such as the Abbott BinaxNOWTM COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test. In winter of 2021-2022, the omicron variant surge made it quickly apparent that although rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are less sensitive than qRT-PCR, the accessibility, ease of use, and rapid read-outs of RDTs made them a sought after and often sold-out item at local suppliers. Here, we sought to qualify the BinaxNOWTM test for use in our university testing program as a method to rule in positive or rule out negative individuals quickly when they sought care at our priority qRT-PCR testing site. To perform this qualification study, we collected matched additional swabs from individuals attending this test site for standard of care qRT-PCR testing. All matched swabs were tested using the BinaxNOWTM RDT. 48 of 110 samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. All samples for which genome sequence could be collected were omicron (41). We observed a calculated sensitivity of 52.1%, specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 72.9% for the BinaxNOWTM tests (n=110). Sensitivity was improved (75.7%) by changing the qRT-PCR positivity threshold from a CT of 40 to a CT of 30. The ROC curve shows that for qRT-PCR positive CT values between 23-40, the BinaxNOWTM test is of limited value diagnostically. Our results suggest that RDT tests could be used to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with substantial viral load, but that a significant fraction of infected individuals would be missed if we used RDT tests exclusively at this time.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics
288	10.1101/2022.02.06.22270558	Objectives: To characterize the clinical severity of COVID-19 caused by Omicron, Delta, and Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variants among hospitalized adults and to compare the effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to prevent hospitalizations caused by each variant. Design: A case-control study of 11,690 hospitalized adults. Setting: Twenty-one hospitals across the United States. Participants: This study included 5728 cases hospitalized with COVID-19 and 5962 controls hospitalized without COVID-19. Cases were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: Alpha (March 11 to July 3, 2021), Delta (July 4 to December 25, 2021), and Omicron (December 26, 2021 to January 14, 2022). Main Outcome Measures: Vaccine effectiveness was calculated using a test-negative design for COVID-19 mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19 hospitalizations by each variant (Alpha, Delta, Omicron). Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, disease severity on the WHO Clinical Progression Ordinal Scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. Results: Vaccine effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent COVID-19-associated hospitalizations included: 85% (95% CI: 82 to 88%) for 2 vaccine doses against Alpha; 85% (95% CI: 83 to 87%) for 2 doses against Delta; 94% (95% CI: 92 to 95%) for 3 doses against Delta; 65% (95% CI: 51 to 75%) for 2 doses against Omicron; and 86% (95% CI: 77 to 91%) for 3 doses against Omicron. Among hospitalized unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, severity on the WHO Clinical Progression Scale was higher for Delta than Alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio [aPOR] 1.28, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for Omicron than Delta (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.77). Compared to unvaccinated cases, severity was lower for vaccinated cases for each variant, including Alpha (aPOR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.49), Delta (aPOR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.51), and Omicron (aPOR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.85). Conclusions: mRNA vaccines were highly effective in preventing COVID-19-associated hospitalizations from Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against Omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against Delta and Alpha. Among adults hospitalized with COVID-19, Omicron caused less severe disease than Delta, but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients hospitalized with COVID-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.	mutation_name: ALPHA | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines

291	10.1101/2022.02.14.480347	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant is replacing Delta, the most prevalent variant worldwide from the beginning of 2021 until early 2022. The Omicron variant is highly transmissible and responsible for a new worldwide COVID-19 wave. Herein, we calculated molecular dynamics simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (wild type, WT) and the Omicron variant of concern. Structural analyses reveal that the SpikeOmicron presents more conformational flexibility than SpikeWT, mainly in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such flexibility results in a broader spectrum of different conformations for SpikeOmicron, whereby the RBD can more easily visit an up-conformational state. We reported how the mutations in this variant may influence the intra- and inter-protomer contacts caused by conformational flexibility. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the differences in conformational flexibility between SpikeOmicron and SpikeWT may explain the observed gains in infectivity, immune system evasion and transmissibility in this novel variant.

292	10.1101/2022.02.15.480592	Hyper-transmissibility with decreased disease severity are typical characteristics of Omicron variant. To understand this phenomenon, we used various bioinformatics approaches to analyze randomly selected genome sequences (one each) of the Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants submitted to NCBI from 15 to 31 December 2021. We show that: (i) Pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants decreases in the order: Wuhan > Gamma > Delta > Omicron; however, the antigenic property follows the order: Omicron > Gamma > Wuhan > Delta. (ii) Omicron Spike RBD has lower pathogenicity but higher antigenicity than other variants. (iii) Decreased disease severity by Omicron variant may be due to its decreased pro-inflammatory and IL-6 stimulation and increased IFN-γ and IL-4 induction efficacy. (iv) Mutations in N protein are associated with decreased IL-6 induction and human DDX21-mediated increased IL-4 production in Omicron. (v) Due to mutations, the stability of S, M, N, and E proteins decreases in the order: Omicron > Gamma > Delta > Wuhan. (vi) Stronger Spike RBD-hACE2 binding in Omicron is associated with increased transmissibility. However, the lowest stability of the Omicron Spike protein makes Spike RBD-hACE2 interaction weak for systemic infection and for causing severe disease. Finally (vii), the highest instability of Omicron E protein may also be associated with decreased viral maturation and low viral load leading to less severe disease and faster recovery. Our method may be used for other similar viruses, and these findings will contribute to the understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the management of emerging variants.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: viral_transmission, disease_severity, protein_stability, binding_to_host_receptor, viral_load

Methods: Weekly incidence of 30 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases/100,000 population defined the start and end of each wave. Hospital admission data were collected through an active national COVID-19-specific surveillance programme. Disease severity was compared across waves by post-imputation random effect multivariable logistic regression models. Severe disease was defined as one or more of acute respiratory distress, supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, intensive-care admission or death. Results: 335,219 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admissions were analysed, constituting 10.4% of 3,216,179 cases recorded during the 4 waves. In the Omicron wave, 8.3% of cases were admitted to hospital (52,038/629,617) compared to 12.9% (71,411/553,530) in the D614G, 12.6% (91,843/726,772) in the Beta and 10.0% (131,083/1,306,260) in the Delta waves (p<0.001). During the Omicron wave, 33.6% of admissions experienced severe disease compared to 52.3%, 63.4% and 63.0% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). The in-hospital case fatality ratio during the Omicron wave was 10.7%, compared to 21.5%, 28.8% and 26.4% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). Compared to the Omicron wave, patients had more severe clinical presentations in the D614G (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.13), Beta (aOR 3.59; CI: 3.49-3.70) and Delta (aOR 3.47: CI: 3.38-3.57) waves. Conclusion: The trend of increasing cases and admissions across South Africa's first three waves shifted in Omicron fourth wave, with a higher and quicker peak but fewer admitted patients, who experienced less clinically severe illness and had a lower case-fatality ratio. Omicron marked a change in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve, clinical profile and deaths in South Africa.

During the Omicron wave, 33.6% of admissions experienced severe disease compared to 52.3%, 63.4% and 63.0% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). The in-hospital case fatality ratio during the Omicron wave was 10.7%, compared to 21.5%, 28.8% and 26.4% in the D614G, Beta and Delta waves (p<0.001). Compared to the Omicron wave, patients had more severe clinical presentations in the D614G (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.01-2.13), Beta (aOR 3.59; CI: 3.49-3.70) and Delta (aOR 3.47: CI: 3.38-3.57) waves. Conclusion: The trend of increasing cases and admissions across South Africa's first three waves shifted in Omicron fourth wave, with a higher and quicker peak but fewer admitted patients, who experienced less clinically severe illness and had a lower case-fatality ratio. Omicron marked a change in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve, clinical profile and deaths in South Africa. Extrapolations to other populations should factor in differing vaccination and prior infection levels.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: disease_severity, fatality_rate
296	10.1101/2022.02.22.21268475	Background: Clinical severity of patients hospitalised with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron (fourth) wave was assessed and compared to trends in the D614G (first), Beta (second), and Delta (third) waves in South Africa. Methods: Weekly incidence of 30 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases/100,000 population defined the start and end of each wave. Hospital admission data were collected through an active national COVID-19-specific surveillance programme. Disease severity was compared across waves by post-imputation random effect multivariable logistic regression models. Severe disease was defined as one or more of acute respiratory distress, supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, intensive-care admission or death. Results: 335,219 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 admissions were analysed, constituting 10.4% of 3,216,179 cases recorded during the 4 waves.

Molnupiravir (MK-4482), an orally administered nucleoside analog, has demonstrated efficacy against earlier SARS-CoV-2 lineages and was recently approved for SARS-CoV-2 infections in high-risk adults. Here we assessed the efficacy of MK-4482 against the earlier Alpha, Beta and Delta VOCs and Omicron in the Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron replication and associated lung disease in vehicle treated hamsters was reduced compared to the earlier VOCs. MK-4482 treatment inhibited virus replication in the lungs of Alpha, Beta and Delta VOC infected hamsters. Importantly, MK-4482 profoundly inhibited virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract of hamsters infected with the Omicron VOC. Consistent with its mutagenic mechanism, MK-4482 treatment had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on infectious virus titers compared to viral RNA genome load. Histopathologic analysis showed that MK-4482 treatment caused a concomitant reduction in the level of lung disease and viral antigen load in infected hamsters across all VOCs examined. Together, our data indicate the potential of MK-4482 as an effective antiviral against known SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, especially Omicron, and likely future SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Starting from published cell infection and viral replication data for the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant, we explore variability in outcomes of viral load and cell infection due to three plausible mechanisms altered by SARS-CoV-2 mutations of delta and omicron. We seek a mechanistic explanation of clinical test results: delta nasal infections express ∼3 orders-of-magnitude higher viral load than alpha, while omicron infections express an additional 1 to 2 orders-of-magnitude rise over delta. Model simulations reveal shortening of the eclipse phase (the time between cellular uptake of the virus and onset of infectious viral replication and shedding) alone can generate 3-5 orders-of-magnitude higher viral load within 2 days post initial infection. Higher viral replication rates by an infected cell can generate at most one order-of-magnitude rise in viral load, whereas higher cell infectability has minimal impact and lowers the viral load.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: viral_load

303	10.1101/2022.03.01.22271582	Clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant infection, including incubation period and transmission rates, distinguish this variant from preceding variants. However, whether the duration of shedding of viable virus differs between omicron and previous variants is not well understood. To characterize how variant and vaccination status impact shedding of viable virus, we serially sampled symptomatic outpatients newly diagnosed with COVID-19. Anterior nasal swabs were tested for viral load, sequencing, and viral culture. Time to PCR conversion was similar between individuals infected with the Delta and the Omicron variant. Time to culture conversion was also similar, with a median time to culture conversion of 6 days (interquartile range 4–8 days) in both groups. There were also no differences in time to PCR or culture conversion by vaccination status.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: viral_incubation_period, viral_transmission

Here we used a simple adapted N95 mask sampling method to demonstrate the impact of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccination on 92 COVID-19 patients to expel virus into the air translating to a transmission risk. Between July and September 2021, when the Delta was the dominant circulating strain in Mumbai, we noted a two-fold increase in the proportion of people expelling virus (95%), about an eighty-fold increase in median viral load and a three-fold increase in high emitter type (41%; people expelling >1000 viral copy numbers in 30 minutes) compared to initial strains of 2020. Eight percent of these patients continued to be high emitters even after eight days of symptom onset, suggesting a probable increased transmission risk for Delta strain even at this stage. There was no significant difference in expelling pattern between partial, full and un-vaccinated individuals suggesting similar transmission risk. We noted significantly more infections among vaccinated study patients and their household members than unvaccinated, probably due to increased duration from vaccination and/or increased risk behaviour upon vaccination due to lower perceived threat. This study provides biological evidence for possible continued transmission of the Delta strain even with vaccination, emphasizing the need to continue COVID-19 appropriate behaviour. The study also indicates that the mask method may be useful for screening future vaccine candidates, therapeutics or interventions for their ability to block transmission.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: viral_transmission, viral_load, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines
305	10.1101/2022.03.02.22271771	BACKGROUND: Qatar experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) wave that started on December 19, 2021 and peaked in mid-January, 2022. We investigated effects of Omicron subvariant (BA.1 and BA.2), previous vaccination, and prior infection on infectiousness of Omicron infections, between December 23, 2021 and February 20, 2022. METHODS: Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to estimate the association between the RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR tests (a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness) and each of the Omicron subvariants, mRNA vaccination, prior infection, reason for RT-qPCR testing, calendar week of RT-qPCR testing (to account for phases of the rapidly evolving Omicron wave), and demographic factors. RESULTS: Compared to BA.1, BA.2 was associated with 3.53 fewer cycles (95% CI: 3.46-3.60), signifying higher infectiousness. Ct value decreased with time since second and third vaccinations. Ct values were highest for those who received their boosters in the month preceding the RT-qPCR test - 0.86 cycles (95% CI: 0.72-1.00) higher than for unvaccinated persons. Ct value was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.20-1.39) cycles higher for those with a prior infection compared to those without prior infection, signifying lower infectiousness. Ct value declined gradually with age. Ct value was lowest for those who were tested because of symptoms and was highest for those who were tested for travel-related purposes. Ct value was lowest during the exponential-growth phase of the Omicron wave and was highest after the wave peaked and was declining. CONCLUSIONS: The BA.2 subvariant appears substantially more infectious than the BA.1 subvariant. This may reflect higher viral load and/or longer duration of infection, thereby explaining the rapid expansion of this subvariant in Qatar.	mutation_name: BA.1 | effect_list: ct_value, infectivity

307	10.1101/2022.03.02.482662	Coronavirus disease 2019 continues to batter the world with the unceasing introduction of new variants of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. In order to understand differences in disease caused by variants of concern and to develop variant-specific vaccines, suitable small animal models are required that mimic disease progression in humans at various stages of life. In this study, we compared the dynamics of infection with two SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Delta and Omicron) in aged (>1 year 3 months old) and young (<5 weeks old) Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). We show that no weight loss occurred in Omicron infected groups regardless of age, while infection with the Delta variant caused weight loss of up to 10% by day 7 post-infection with slower and incomplete recovery in the aged group. Omicron replicated to similar levels as Delta in the lungs, trachea and nasal turbinates, with no significant differences in the tissue viral loads of aged versus young animals for either variant. In contrast to rare necrosis observed in Omicron-infected animals regardless of age, severe necrosis was observed in the olfactory epithelium in Delta-infected animals. Omicron infection also resulted in mild pulmonary disease in both young and aged animals compared to the moderate acute necrotizing bronchointerstitial pneumonia seen in Delta-infected animals. These results suggest that Omicron infection results in an attenuated clinical disease outlook in Syrian hamsters compared to infection with the Delta variant irrespective of age.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: disease_severity

Therefore, it becomes imperative to study and understand the effect of mutations on viral evolution, fitness and pathogenesis. In this regard, we performed a time-series analysis on 59541 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from around the world. These 59541 genomes were grouped according to the months (January 2020-March 2021) based on the collection date. Meta-analysis of this data led us to identify highly significant mutations in viral genomes. Correlation and Hierarchical Clustering of the highly significant mutations led us to the identification of sixteen mutation pairs that were correlated with each other and were present in >30% of the genomes under study. Among these mutation pairs, some of the mutations have been shown to contribute towards the viral replication and fitness suggesting the possible role of other unexplored mutations in viral evolution and pathogenesis. Additionally, we employed various computational tools to investigate the effects of T85I, P323L, and Q57H mutations in Non-structural protein 2 (Nsp2), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Open reading frame 3a (ORF3a) respectively. Results show that T85I in Nsp2 and Q57H in ORF3a mutations are deleterious and destabilize the parent protein whereas P323L in RdRp is neutral and has a stabilizing effect.

313	10.1111/1751-7915.14064	Summary The Omicron variant rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain in South Africa and elsewhere. This review explores whether this rise was due to an increased transmission of the variant or its escape from population immunity by an extensively mutated spike protein. The mutations affected the structure of the spike protein leading to the loss of neutralization by most, but not all, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Omicron also shows substantial immune escape from serum antibodies in convalescent patients and vaccinees. A booster immunization increased, however, the titre and breadth of antiviral antibody response. The cellular immune response against Omicron was largely preserved explaining a satisfying protection of boosted vaccinees against severe infections. Clinicians observed less severe infection with Omicron, but other scientists warned that this must not necessarily reflect less intrinsic virulence. However, in animal experiments with mice and hamsters, Omicron infections also displayed a lesser virulence than previous VOCs and lung functions were less compromised. Cell biologists demonstrated that Omicron differs from Delta by preferring the endocytic pathway for cell entry over fusion with the plasma membrane which might explain Omicron?s distinct replication along the respiratory tract compared with Delta. Omicron represents a distinct evolutionary lineage that deviated from the mainstream of evolving SARS-CoV-2 already in mid-2020 raising questions about where it circulated before getting widespread in December 2021. The role of Omicron for the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic is discussed.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs, immune_escape, sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera, viral_virulence, disease_severity

We sought to compare clinical outcomes of infections caused by these two strains, confirmed by whole genome sequencing, over a short period of time, from respiratory samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at a large medical center. We found that infections caused by the Omicron variant caused significantly less morbidity, including admission to the hospital and requirement for oxygen supplementation, and significantly less mortality than those caused by the Delta variant.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: disease_severity, risk_of_hospitalization, fatality_rate
317	10.1126/science.abf4058	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral proteins interact with the eukaryotic translation machinery, and inhibitors of translation have potent antiviral effects. We found that the drug plitidepsin (aplidin), which has limited clinical approval, possesses antiviral activity (90% inhibitory concentration = 0.88 nM) that is more potent than remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by a factor of 27.5, with limited toxicity in cell culture. Through the use of a drug-resistant mutant, we show that the antiviral activity of plitidepsin against SARS-CoV-2 is mediated through inhibition of the known target eEF1A (eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A). We demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of plitidepsin treatment in two mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a reduction of viral replication in the lungs by two orders of magnitude using prophylactic treatment. Our results indicate that plitidepsin is a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.	mutation_name:  | effect_list: 
318	10.1126/science.abg5827	There is an urgent need for antiviral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. We screened a library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs against OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that causes the common cold and evaluated the top hits against SARS-CoV-2. Twenty drugs significantly inhibited replication of both viruses in vitro. Eight of these drugs inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro, with the most potent being masitinib, an orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor. X-ray crystallography and biochemistry show that masitinib acts as a competitive inhibitor of 3CLpro. Mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then treated with masitinib showed >200-fold reduction in viral titers in the lungs and nose, as well as reduced lung inflammation. Masitinib was also effective in vitro against all tested variants of concern (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1).	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs

321	10.1126/science.abi9745	Several fast-spreading variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become the dominant circulating strains in the COVID-19 pandemic. We report here cryo-EM structures of the full-length spike (S) trimers of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, as well as their biochemical and antigenic properties. Amino acid substitutions in the B.1.1.7 protein increase the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and also the binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced receptor engagement may account for the increased transmissibility. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the major neutralizing sites on the S protein, making it resistant to some potent neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide structural details on how SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to enhance viral fitness and immune evasion.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: binding_to_host_receptor, viral_transmission, viral_fitness, immune_escape

323	10.1126/science.abn8652	The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant of concern evades antibody-mediated immunity that comes from vaccination or infection with earlier variants due to accumulation of numerous spike mutations. To understand the Omicron antigenic shift, we determined cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystal structures of the spike protein and the receptor-binding domain bound to the broadly neutralizing sarbecovirus monoclonal antibody (mAb) S309 (the parent mAb of sotrovimab) and to the human ACE2 receptor. We provide a blueprint for understanding the marked reduction of binding of other therapeutic mAbs that leads to dampened neutralizing activity. Remodeling of interactions between the Omicron receptor-binding domain and human ACE2 likely explains the enhanced affinity for the host receptor relative to the ancestral virus.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: immune_escape, binding_to_antibodies, sensitivity_to_antibodies, binding_to_host_receptor
324	10.1128/jvi.00203-08	Sequencing and reversion analysis of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) temperature-sensitive (ts) viruses has identified putative ts mutations in the replicase nonstructural proteins (nsp's) of these coronaviruses. In this study, reverse transcriptase PCR sequencing of the RNA genome of an isolate of the MHV ts virus Alb ts6, referred to as Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A, identified a putative ts mutation in nsp5 (T10651C, Val148Ala), the viral 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro). The introduction of the T10651C mutation into the infectious MHV clone resulted in the recovery of a mutant virus, the nsp5/V148A virus, that demonstrated reduced growth and nsp5 proteinase activity identical to that of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A at the nonpermissive temperature. Sequence analysis of 40 degrees C revertants of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A identified primary reversion to Ala148Val in nsp5, as well as two independent second-site mutations resulting in Ser133Asn and His134Tyr substitutions in nsp5. The introduction of the Ser133Asn or His134Tyr substitution into the cloned nsp5/V148A mutant virus background resulted in the recovery of viruses with increased growth fitness and the partial restoration of nsp5 activity at the nonpermissive temperature. Modeling of the nsp5 structure of Alb/ts/nsp5/V148A predicted that the Val148Ala mutation alters residue 148 interactions with residues of the substrate binding S1 subsite of the nsp5 active-site cavity. This study identifies novel residues in nsp5 that may be important for regulating substrate specificity and nsp5 proteinase activity.	mutation_name:  | effect_list: 
325	10.1128/msystems.00030-21	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in 92 million cases in a span of 1 year. The study focuses on understanding population-specific variations attributing its high rate of infections in specific geographical regions particularly in the United States. Rigorous phylogenomic network analysis of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes (245) inferred five central clades named a (ancestral), b, c, d, and e (subtypes e1 and e2). Clade d and subclade e2 were found exclusively comprised of U.S. strains. Clades were distinguished by 10 co-mutational combinations in Nsp3, ORF8, Nsp13, S, Nsp12, Nsp2, and Nsp6. Our analysis revealed that only 67.46% of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations were at the amino acid level. T1103P mutation in Nsp3 was predicted to increase protein stability in 238 strains except for 6 strains which were marked as ancestral type, whereas co-mutation (P409L and Y446C) in Nsp13 were found in 64 genomes from the United States highlighting its 100% co-occurrence. Docking highlighted mutation (D614G) caused reduction in binding of spike proteins with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but it also showed better interaction with the TMPRSS2 receptor contributing to high transmissibility among U.S. strains. We also found host proteins, MYO5A, MYO5B, and MYO5C, that had maximum interaction with viral proteins (nucleocapsid [N], spike [S], and membrane [M] proteins). Thus, blocking the internalization pathway by inhibiting MYO5 proteins which could be an effective target for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatment. The functional annotations of the host-pathogen interaction (HPI) network were found to be closely associated with hypoxia and thrombotic conditions, confirming the vulnerability and severity of infection. We also screened CpG islands in Nsp1 and N conferring the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to enter and trigger zinc antiviral protein (ZAP) activity inside the host cell. IMPORTANCE In the current study, we presented a global view of mutational pattern observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. This provided a who-infect-whom geographical model since the early pandemic. This is hitherto the most comprehensive comparative genomics analysis of full-length genomes for co-mutations at different geographical regions especially in U.S. strains. Compositional structural biology results suggested that mutations have a balance of opposing forces affecting pathogenicity suggesting that only a few mutations are effective at the translation level. Novel HPI analysis and CpG predictions elucidate the proof of concept of hypoxia and thrombotic conditions in several patients. Thus, the current study focuses the understanding of population-specific variations attributing a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in specific geographical regions which may eventually be vital for the most severely affected countries and regions for sharp development of custom-made vindication strategies.	mutation_name: NSP3_T1103P | effect_list: protein_stability

327	10.1128/spectrum.02732-21	The process of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic diversification is still ongoing and has very recently led to the emergence of a new variant of concern (VOC), defined as Omicron or B.1.1.529. Omicron VOC is the most divergent variant identified so far and has generated immediate concern for its potential capability to increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and, more worryingly, to escape therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies. Nevertheless, a clear definition of the Omicron VOC mutational spectrum is still missing. Herein, we provide a comprehensive definition and functional characterization (in terms of infectivity and/or antigenicity) of mutations characterizing the Omicron VOC. In particular, 887,475 SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC whole-genome sequences were retrieved from the GISAID database and used to precisely define its specific patterns of mutations across the different viral proteins. In addition, the functional characterization of Omicron VOC spike mutations was finely discussed according to published manuscripts. Lastly, residues characterizing the Omicron VOC and the previous four VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) were mapped on the three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to assess their localization in the different spike domains. Overall, our study will assist with deciphering the Omicron VOC mutational profile and will shed more light on its clinical implications. This is critical considering that Omicron VOC is currently the predominant variant worldwide. IMPORTANCE The Omicron variant of concern (VOC) has a peculiar spectrum of mutations characterized by the acquisition of mutations or deletions rarely detected in previously identified variants, particularly in the spike glycoprotein. Such mutations, mostly residing in the receptor-binding domain, could play a pivotal role in enhancing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectivity (by increasing binding affinity for ACE2), jeopardizing spike recognition by therapeutic and vaccine-induced antibodies and causing diagnostic assay failure. To our knowledge, this is one of the first exhaustive descriptions of newly emerged mutations underlying the Omicron VOC and its biological and clinical implications.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect_list: viral_transmission, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs, infectivity, binding_to_host_receptor, effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: 21 hospitals across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 11 690 adults (≥18 years) admitted to hospital: 5728 with covid-19 (cases) and 5962 without covid-19 (controls). Patients were classified into SARS-CoV-2 variant groups based on viral whole genome sequencing, and, if sequencing did not reveal a lineage, by the predominant circulating variant at the time of hospital admission: alpha (11 March to 3 July 2021), delta (4 July to 25 December 2021), and omicron (26 December 2021 to 14 January 2022). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vaccine effectiveness calculated using a test negative design for mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 related hospital admissions by each variant (alpha, delta, omicron). Among patients admitted to hospital with covid-19, disease severity on the World Health Organization’s clinical progression scale was compared among variants using proportional odds regression. RESULTS: Effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines to prevent covid-19 associated hospital admissions was 85% (95% confidence interval 82% to 88%) for two vaccine doses against the alpha variant, 85% (83% to 87%) for two doses against the delta variant, 94% (92% to 95%) for three doses against the delta variant, 65% (51% to 75%) for two doses against the omicron variant; and 86% (77% to 91%) for three doses against the omicron variant. In-hospital mortality was 7.6% (81/1060) for alpha, 12.2% (461/3788) for delta, and 7.1% (40/565) for omicron. Among unvaccinated patients with covid-19 admitted to hospital, severity on the WHO clinical progression scale was higher for the delta versus alpha variant (adjusted proportional odds ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.46), and lower for the omicron versus delta variant (0.61, 0.49 to 0.77). Compared with unvaccinated patients, severity was lower for vaccinated patients for each variant, including alpha (adjusted proportional odds ratio 0.33, 0.23 to 0.49), delta (0.44, 0.37 to 0.51), and omicron (0.61, 0.44 to 0.85). CONCLUSIONS: mRNA vaccines were found to be highly effective in preventing covid-19 associated hospital admissions related to the alpha, delta, and omicron variants, but three vaccine doses were required to achieve protection against omicron similar to the protection that two doses provided against the delta and alpha variants. Among adults admitted to hospital with covid-19, the omicron variant was associated with less severe disease than the delta variant but still resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Vaccinated patients admitted to hospital with covid-19 had significantly lower disease severity than unvaccinated patients for all the variants.	mutation_name: ALPHA | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines

331	10.1172/jci.insight.155483	Isolation guidelines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are largely derived from data collected prior to the emergence of the delta variant. We followed a cohort of ambulatory patients with postvaccination breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections with longitudinal collection of nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification, whole-genome sequencing, and viral culture. All delta variant infections in our cohort were symptomatic, compared with 64% of non-delta variant infections. Symptomatic delta variant breakthrough infections were characterized by higher initial viral load, longer duration of virologic shedding by PCR, greater likelihood of replication-competent virus at early stages of infection, and longer duration of culturable virus compared with non-delta variants. The duration of time since vaccination was also correlated with both duration of PCR positivity and duration of detection of replication-competent virus. Nonetheless, no individuals with symptomatic delta variant infections had replication-competent virus by day 10 after symptom onset or 24 hours after resolution of symptoms. These data support US CDC isolation guidelines as of November 2021, which recommend isolation for 10 days or until symptom resolution and reinforce the importance of prompt testing and isolation among symptomatic individuals with delta breakthrough infections. Additional data are needed to evaluate these relationships among asymptomatic and more severe delta variant breakthrough infections.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: viral_load, viral_replication
332	10.1248/bpb.b21-01081	A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain, the Omicron variant (Pango lineage B.1.1.529), was identified in South Africa in late September 2021. This variant has multiple spike protein deletions and mutations, with 15 amino acid substitutions detected in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). These RBD substitutions are hypothesized to increase infectivity and reduce antibody affinity, which is supported by recent data showing that the Omicron variant spreads faster than the Delta variant (Pango lineage B.1.617.2). Thus, this increase in infectivity should lead to Omicron being the dominant variant and developing screening tests that discriminate between Omicron and Delta variants is urgently needed. In this study, we successfully developed a novel screening assay using high-resolution melting analysis, in which two genotypes at G446/L452 and S477/T478 RBD were determined (G446S/L452 and S477N/T478K for Omicron; G446/L452R and S477/T478K for Delta). Using synthetic DNA fragments, we confirmed both melting point and melting peak shape of the RBD Omicron variant was distinguishable from those of wild-type and the Delta variant. Although this study was conducted without clinical samples, these results suggest that our HRM-based genotyping method can readily identify the Omicron and Delta variants. This simple method should contribute to the rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants and thus prevent potential widespread infection and inflow of the Omicron variant.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect_list: infectivity, binding_to_antibodies, viral_transmission, effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics

334	10.1371/journal.pbio.3001006	Since entering the human population, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 [COVID-19]) has spread worldwide, causing >100 million infections and >2 million deaths. While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether many of these changes impact adaptation, replication, or transmission of the virus. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, virus stocks, and passaging experiments, together with kinetic virus replication data from nonhuman Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells. Overall, our study uncovers sequence features in SARS-CoV-2 variants that determine cell-specific replication and highlights the need to monitor SARS-CoV-2 stocks carefully when phenotyping newly emerging variants or potential variants of concern.	mutation_name: NSP2_T85I | effect_list: viral_replication, viral_replication

We utilize genetic data from all strains available from GISAID and countries’ regional information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutations infer conformational changes to the protein that significantly alter its structure when compared to the reference protein.	mutation_name: N_P13L | effect_list: protein_conformational_optimization, fatality_rate

In this study, we analyzed 129 full-length genomes of SARS-CoV-2 viruses of a Canadian population during early phase of the pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed three major paths of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into Canada. Twenty-one substitutions that have frequencies greater than 3% of viral population were identified. Analysis of these substitutions indicated that P1427I (ORF1b), Y1464C (ORF1b), and Q57H (ORF3a) might affect functions of the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins. Additionally, we found the evidence of positive selection on the ORF3a and codon 614 of Spike protein, suggesting the viral components responsible for host entry and activation of inflammation response were targeted by host immune responses. The study showed genomic variation and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a Canadian population.

342	10.1371/journal.ppat.1009914	As novel SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge, it is critical that their potential to cause severe disease and evade vaccine-induced immunity is rapidly assessed in humans and studied in animal models. In early January 2021, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant designated B.1.429 comprising 2 lineages, B.1.427 and B.1.429, was originally detected in California (CA) and it was shown to have enhanced infectivity in vitro and decreased antibody neutralization by plasma from convalescent patients and vaccine recipients. Here we examine the virulence, transmissibility, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity for B 1.427 and B 1.429 in the Syrian hamster model. We find that both variants exhibit enhanced virulence as measured by increased body weight loss compared to hamsters infected with ancestral B.1 (614G), with B.1.429 causing the most marked body weight loss among the 3 variants. Faster dissemination from airways to parenchyma and more severe lung pathology at both early and late stages were also observed with B.1.429 infections relative to B.1. (614G) and B.1.427 infections. In addition, subgenomic viral RNA (sgRNA) levels were highest in oral swabs of hamsters infected with B.1.429, however sgRNA levels in lungs were similar in all three variants. This demonstrates that B.1.429 replicates to higher levels than ancestral B.1 (614G) or B.1.427 in the oropharynx but not in the lungs. In multi-virus in-vivo competition experiments, we found that B.1. (614G), epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) and gamma (P.1) dramatically outcompete alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351) and zeta (P.2) in the lungs. In the nasal cavity, B.1. (614G), gamma, and epsilon dominate, but the highly infectious alpha variant also maintains a moderate size niche. We did not observe significant differences in airborne transmission efficiency among the B.1.427, B.1.429 and ancestral B.1 (614G) and WA-1 variants in hamsters. These results demonstrate enhanced virulence and high relative oropharyngeal replication of the epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) variant in Syrian hamsters compared to an ancestral B.1 (614G) variant.	mutation_name: B.1 | effect_list: viral_transmission

347	10.1371/journal.ppat.1010053	COVID-19 patients transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to minks in the Netherlands in April 2020. Subsequently, the mink-associated virus (miSARS-CoV-2) spilled back over into humans. Genetic sequences of the miSARS-CoV-2 identified a new genetic variant known as “Cluster 5” that contained mutations in the spike protein. However, the functional properties of these “Cluster 5” mutations have not been well established. In this study, we found that the Y453F mutation located in the RBD domain of miSARS-CoV-2 is an adaptive mutation that enhances binding to mink ACE2 and other orthologs of Mustela species without compromising, and even enhancing, its ability to utilize human ACE2 as a receptor for entry. Structural analysis suggested that despite the similarity in the overall binding mode of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human and mink ACE2, Y34 of mink ACE2 was better suited to interact with a Phe rather than a Tyr at position 453 of the viral RBD due to less steric clash and tighter hydrophobic-driven interaction. Additionally, the Y453F spike exhibited resistance to convalescent serum, posing a risk for vaccine development. Thus, our study suggests that since the initial transmission from humans, SARS-CoV-2 evolved to adapt to the mink host, leading to widespread circulation among minks while still retaining its ability to efficiently utilize human ACE2 for entry, thus allowing for transmission of the miSARS-CoV-2 back into humans. These findings underscore the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Mustela species and other susceptible hosts in order to prevent future outbreaks.	mutation_name: SPIKE_Y453F | effect_list: binding_to_host_receptor, entry_efficiency, intermolecular_interactions, sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines
348	10.1503/cmaj.211248	BACKGROUND: Between February and June 2021, the initial wild-type strains of SARS-CoV-2 were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, by new variants of concern (VOCs), first those with the N501Y mutation (i.e., Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants) and then the Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. METHODS: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables. We adjusted models for age, sex, time, vaccination status, comorbidities and pregnancy status. We included health units as random intercepts. RESULTS: Our cohort included 212 326 people. Compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42%–63%) for hospitalization, 89% (95% CI 67%–117%) for ICU admission and 51% (95% CI 30%–78%) for death. Increased risk with the Delta variant was more pronounced at 108% (95% CI 78%–140%) for hospitalization, 235% (95% CI 160%–331%) for ICU admission and 133% (95% CI 54%–231%) for death. INTERPRETATION: The increasing virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will lead to a considerably larger, and more deadly, pandemic than would have occurred in the absence of the emergence of VOCs.	mutation_name: ALPHA | effect_list: viral_virulence, risk_of_hospitalization, fatality_rate, viral_transmission

351	10.1503/cmaj.211248	BACKGROUND: Between February and June 2021, the initial wild-type strains of SARS-CoV-2 were supplanted in Ontario, Canada, by new variants of concern (VOCs), first those with the N501Y mutation (i.e., Alpha/B1.1.17, Beta/B.1.351 and Gamma/P.1 variants) and then the Delta/B.1.617 variant. The increased transmissibility of these VOCs has been documented, but knowledge about their virulence is limited. We used Ontario’s COVID-19 case data to evaluate the virulence of these VOCs compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, as measured by risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. METHODS: We created a retrospective cohort of people in Ontario who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were screened for VOCs, with dates of test report between Feb. 7 and June 27, 2021. We constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models with hospitalization, ICU admission and death as outcome variables. We adjusted models for age, sex, time, vaccination status, comorbidities and pregnancy status. We included health units as random intercepts. RESULTS: Our cohort included 212 326 people. Compared with non-VOC SARS-CoV-2 strains, the adjusted elevation in risk associated with N501Y-positive variants was 52% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42%–63%) for hospitalization, 89% (95% CI 67%–117%) for ICU admission and 51% (95% CI 30%–78%) for death. Increased risk with the Delta variant was more pronounced at 108% (95% CI 78%–140%) for hospitalization, 235% (95% CI 160%–331%) for ICU admission and 133% (95% CI 54%–231%) for death. INTERPRETATION: The increasing virulence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs will lead to a considerably larger, and more deadly, pandemic than would have occurred in the absence of the emergence of VOCs.	mutation_name: GAMMA | effect_list: viral_virulence, risk_of_hospitalization, fatality_rate, viral_transmission
352	10.20944/preprints202006.0157.v1	The emergence of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in marked as the highest pathogenic coronavirus that has crossed from the hosts to the human population in the twenty-first century. The spreading of COVID-19 in different chinese cities and around the world is travel-related viral spread with the unprecedented nosocomial outbreaks. It has also shown with high case-fatality rates, indeed to urgent prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Scientific advancements of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic allowed for rapid progress to understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. This review highlights the the genomic structure of SARS-CoV-2 with the proposed roles of genotype and phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 in pathogenesis and discuss recent results supporting treatment strategies of COVID-19 with a special focus on how these new insights may facilitate rational development of SARS-CoV-2 for targeted therapies in the future.	mutation_name:  | effect_list:

Since the first report of SARS-CoV-2 on March 10 th , 2020 in Turkey, more than 150,000 people in the country have been infected with this virus. In this study, a total of 80 genomic virulent strains from Turkey which were uploaded in NCBI and GISAID database were analyzed with other genomic sequences from different countries with the aim to characterize notable genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 and to identify some novel mutations. Consistent with other studies, the combination of variants at positions C3037T, C14408T and A23403G were most common mutations (73%), that exist together in isolates from Turkey. Our secondary structure prediction analysis also highlighted 11 unique non-substitutional mutations from viral SARS-COV-2 isolates of Turkey in different regions such as in spike (S) protein and non-structural proteins (Nsp2, Nsp3, NSP4, and NSP12/RdRP). Of these 11 mutations, nine of them have been found to be involved in structural alterations at different sites. 3/9 mutants (A771V, T1238I and G1251V) cause alteration in structure of S protein, while the rest of them induces structural changes in Nsp2 (A206T, R207C, T265I), Nsp3 (A1824V), Nsp4 (M2796I) and NSP12 (A4489V). These mutations identified here might have significant functional implications that needs to be addressed for future studies in the context of vaccine engineering and therapeutic interventions. Moreover, transmission and phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple independent sources of introductions for infection of hCovs in Turkey and close phylogenetic relationship of Turkish strains with Saudi strains.	mutation_name: NSP12_A4489V | effect_list: protein_conformational_optimization

We have examined the structure and receptor binding properties of spike proteins from the B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (SA) variants to better understand the evolution of the virus in humans. Both variants’ spikes have the same mutation, N501Y, in their receptor-binding domains that confers tighter ACE2 binding and this substitution relies on a common earlier substitution (D614G) to achieve the tighter binding. Each variant spike has also acquired a key change in structure that impacts virus pathogenesis. Unlike other SARS-CoV-2 spikes, the spike from the UK variant is stable against detrimerisation on binding ACE2. This feature primarily arises from the acquisition of a substitution at the S1-S2 furin site that allows for near-complete cleavage. In the SA variant spike, the presence of a new substitution, K417N, again on the background of the D614G substitution, enables the spike trimer to adopt fully open conformations that are required for receptor binding.

366	10.21203/rs.3.rs-70482/v1	A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an “up” conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines, viral_replication, infectivity, viral_load, viral_transmission, effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs

The infection first emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread worldwide. The ongoing outbreak has posed an urgent worldwide health threat due to the rapid transmittable potential and high mortality rate. Due to the critical role of none structural protein − 12 (NSP-12) in COVID-19. This study tries to investigate the link between genotype-phenotype NSP-12 variation and the prevalence of this disease. Methods We analyzed approximately 2 million Nsp12 of SARS-CoV-2 protein sequence from January 2020 until June 2021. Python programming language was utilized to preprocess and apply inclusion criteria on FASTA files to prepare a list of suitable samples for clustering samples. NSP-12 regions were aligned to the reference sequence to compare and identify mutation patterns, categorized based on frequency and continent. Results The rate of ‌NSP-12 mutation in divided geographical areas was different. Based on continental studies, the P227L and G671S mutations have multiplied over time and in European and Asian societies in recent months. According to biochemical studies, the occurrence of G671S mutation increases the stability of the protein. Conclusion We concluded that NSP-12 P227L and G671S mutations in SARS-CoV-2 are increased in recent months. Further studies will be required to investigate whether these mutations impact the severity of the disease.	mutation_name: NSP12_G671S | effect_list: disease_severity, protein_stability

Detailed patient level data from all SARS-CoV-2 patients with VOC infection admitted to our centre between 20-December-2020 and 12-May-2021 were analysed. Outcomes were compared with a cohort of 846 patients admitted January-April 2020.Findings: There were 838 VOC infections in Singapore in the study period. After adjusting for age and gender, B.1.617.2 infection was associated with higher odds of oxygen requirement, ICU admission, or death (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 4·90, [95% CI 1·43-30·78]. 157 patients with VOCs were admitted to our centre. After adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and vaccination, aOR for pneumonia with B.1.617.2 was 1·88 [95% CI 0·95-3·76]) compared with wild-type. B.1.617.2 was associated with significantly lower PCR Ct values and significantly longer duration of Ct value ≤30 (estimated median duration 18 days for B.1.617.2, 13 days for wild-type). Vaccine breakthrough cases were less severe.Interpretation: There was a signal toward increased severity associated with B.1.617.2. The association of B.1.617.2 with lower Ct value and longer viral shedding provides a potential mechanism for increased transmissibility. These findings provide a strong impetus for the rapid implementation of vaccination programmes.Funding Information: National Medical Research Council grants COVID19RF-001 and COVID19RF-008.Declaration of Interests: BEY reports personal fees from Roche and Sanofi, outside the submitted work.

370	10.22209/ic.v62s2a02	Variants of Concern of SARS-CoV-2 (VOCs), the new coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, have emerged in several countries. Mutations in the amino acid 484 of the Spike protein are particularly important and associated with some of these variants: E484K or E484Q. These mutations have been associated with evasion to neutralizing antibodies. Restriction enzyme analysis is proposed as a rapid method to detect these mutations. A search on GISAID was performed in April 2021 to detect the frequency of these two mutations in the sequence available and their association with other lineages. E484K, present in some VOCs, has emerged in several other lineages and is frequently found in recent viral isolates. A small amplicon from the Spike gene was digested with two enzymes: HpyAV, and MseI. The use of these two enzymes allows the detection of mutations at position 484, and to differentiate between these three conditions: non-mutated, and the presence of E484K or E484Q. A 100% correlation was observed with sequencing results. The proposed methodology, which allows for the screening of a great number of samples, will probably help to provide more information on the prevalence and epidemiology of these mutations worldwide, to select the candidates for whole-genome sequencing.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect_list: immune_escape

372	10.26355/eurrev_202112_27653	Recently a new variant of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from South Africa. World Health Organization (WHO) named this mutant as a variant of concern - Omicron (B.1.1.529) on 26th November 2021. This variant exhibited more than thirty amino acid mutations in the spike protein. This mutation rate is exceeding the other variants by approximately 5-11 times in the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein. Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant might have enhanced transmissibility and immune evasion. This new variant can reinfect individuals previously infected with other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Scientists expressed their concern about the efficacy of already existing COVID-19 vaccines against Omicron (B.1.1.529) infections. Some of the crucial mutations that are detected in the receptor-binding domain of the Omicron variant have been shared by previously evolved SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on the Omicron mutation profile in the receptor-binding domain and motif, it might have collectively enhanced or intermediary infectivity relative to its previous variants. Due to extensive mutations in the spike protein, the Omicron variant might evade the immunity in the vaccinated individuals.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect_list: viral_transmission, immune_escape, infectivity, risk_of_reinfection, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines

First detected in Israel in April 2021 following importations from Argentina and several European countries, the Lambda variant infected 18 individuals belonging to two main transmission chains without further spread. Micro-neutralisation assays following Comirnaty (BNT162b2 mRNA, BioNTech-Pfizer) vaccination demonstrated a significant 1.6-fold reduction in neutralising titres compared with the wild type virus, suggesting increased susceptibility of vaccinated individuals to infection.	mutation_name: C.37 | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines
374	10.2807/1560-7917.es.2022.27.10.2100815	BACKGROUND: The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 had become predominant globally by November 2021. AIM: We evaluated transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the Delta variant in an outbreak in southern China. METHODS: Data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts were retrospectively collected from the outbreak that occurred in Guangdong, China in May and June 2021. Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. RESULTS: We identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. Mean estimates of latent and incubation period were 3.9 days and 5.8 days, respectively. Relatively higher viral load was observed in infections with Delta than in infections with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Secondary attack rate among close contacts of cases with Delta was 1.4%, and 73.1% (95% credible interval (CrI): 32.9–91.4) of the transmissions occurred before onset. Index cases without vaccination (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.84; 95% CI: 1.19–8.45) or with an incomplete vaccination series (aOR: 6.02; 95% CI: 2.45–18.16) were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received the complete primary vaccination series. DISCUSSION: Patients infected with the Delta variant had more rapid symptom onset compared with the wild type. The time-varying serial interval should be accounted for in estimation of reproduction numbers. The higher viral load and higher risk of pre-symptomatic transmission indicated the challenges in control of infections with the Delta variant.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: viral_load, viral_transmission, viral_incubation_period, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines

376	10.33263/briac125.68956914	COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 that belongs to the Corona groups. The subgroups of the coronavirus families are α, β, γ, and δ coronavirus. On June 15, 2021, the string λ of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated as a variant of interest via the World Health Organization. This string has a high prevalence in some parts of South American countries, but it occurred only occasionally in Brazil. This study confirms that mutations in the λ-spike protein can be destroyed the neutralizing antibodies and increase infectivity. Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 have an evolutionary superpower called “recombination” which permits the mixing of their genomes into novel combinations. Unlike regular mutation, which precedes slowly one change at a time, recombination can produce whole changes in a coronavirus genome. Although right now, is a concern, a mixing of λ with other variants such as is much more of a concern compared to alone variants. There is another item: the recombination can arise within the sample after it was taken from the infected person, not while it was inside their body. © 2021 by the authors.	mutation_name: LAMBDA | effect_list: infectivity, sensitivity_to_antibodies

With the global transmission of the virus, a large number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have also appeared, especially, emerging strains that have recently been discovered in the United Kingdom (variant 20I/501Y.V1, lineage B.1.1.7), South Africa (variant 20H/501Y.V2, lineage B.1.351), and Brazil (variant 20 J/501Y.V3, and lineage P.1).

Although this property is suspected to result from a specific mutation in the spike glycoprotein, D614G, there are 9 mutations that distinguish the UK variant B.1.1.7 from Wuhan-Hu-1 yet to be evaluated for functional effects. We asked if mutated positions fixed in UK variant B.1.1.7 may be involved in the virus life cycle, or evasion of the immune response, by modeling the UK variant spike protein and conducting structural analysis of mutations on the spike glycoprotein trimer (protomer) complexed to ACE2. Importantly, 4 out of 9 differences between the UK variant B.1.1.7 and Wuhan-Hu-1 spike protein alter direct intermolecular interactions. N501Y increased affinity between the spike protein and ACE2. The mutations at A570D, D614G and S982A reduced contact between individual chains of the trimeric spike protomer, potentially enhancing cleavage into S1 and S2 subunits, dynamic structural rearrangement and host cell fusion mechanisms.

388	10.3389/fcell.2021.697035	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been undergoing various mutations. The analysis of the structural and energetic effects of mutations on protein-protein interactions between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies will be beneficial for epidemic surveillance, diagnosis, and optimization of neutralizing agents. According to the molecular dynamics simulation, a key mutation N439K in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD region created a new salt bridge with Glu329 of hACE2, which resulted in greater electrostatic complementarity, and created a weak salt bridge with Asp442 of RBD. Furthermore, the N439K-mutated RBD bound hACE2 with a higher affinity than wild-type, which may lead to more infectious. In addition, the N439K-mutated RBD was markedly resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody REGN10987, which may lead to the failure of neutralization. The results show consistent with the previous experimental conclusion and clarify the structural mechanism under affinity changes. Our methods will offer guidance on the assessment of the infection efficiency and antigenicity effect of continuing mutations in SARS-CoV-2.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N439K | effect_list: host_virus_interactions, binding_to_host_receptor, infectivity, sensitivity_to_antibodies
389	10.3389/fcimb.2021.753249	BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is evolving continuously with emergence of several variants of increasing transmission capabilities and pandemic potential. Generation of variants occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature of viral genome, which is further enhanced by variable selection pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without mild gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic symptoms. However, the virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation, infection in various organs, and host response to emerging variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation. Several studies have reported underlying diseases including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders, and immunocompromised conditions as significant risk factors for severe form of COVID-19. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are also highly predominant in the population, which can alter COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response. We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases. METHODS: In this review, we have elucidated the emergence and characteristic features of new SARS-CoV2 variants, mechanisms of infection and host immune response, GI and hepatic manifestation with radiologic features of COVID-19, and outcomes in pre-existing liver and GI diseases. KEY FINDINGS: Emerging variants of concern (VOC) have shown increased transmissibility and virulence with severe COVID-19 presentation and mortality. There is a drastic swift of variants from the first wave to the next wave of infections with predominated major VOC including alpha (B.1.1.7, UK), beta (B.1.351, South Africa), gamma (B.1.1.28.1, Brazil), and delta (B1.1.617, India) variants. The mutations in the spike protein of VOC are implicated for increased receptor binding (N501Y, P681R) and immune escape (L452R, E484K/Q, T478K/R) to host response. Pre-existing liver and GI diseases not only have altered tissue expression and distribution of viral entry ACE2 receptor but also host protease TMPRSS2, which is required for both spike protein binding and cleavage to initiate infection. Altered immune status due to pre-existing conditions results in delayed virus clearance or prolonged viremia. Even though GI and hepatic manifestations of SARS-CoV2 are less severe, the detection of virus in patient’s stool indicates GI tropism, replication, and shedding from the GI tract. COVID-19-induced liver injury, acute hepatic decompensation, and incidences of acute-on-chronic liver failure may change the disease outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the spike protein of emerging variants, immunomodulation by viral proteins, and altered expression of host viral entry receptor in pre-existing diseases are the key determinants of host response to SARS-CoV2 and its disease outcome.	mutation_name: B.1.1.28.1 | effect_list: viral_transmission, viral_virulence, fatality_rate
390	10.3389/fcimb.2021.753249	BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 is evolving continuously with emergence of several variants of increasing transmission capabilities and pandemic potential. Generation of variants occurs through accumulation of mutations due to the RNA nature of viral genome, which is further enhanced by variable selection pressures of this ongoing pandemic. COVID-19 presentations of SARS-CoV2 are mainly pulmonary manifestations with or without mild gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic symptoms. However, the virus has evolved beyond pulmonary manifestations to multisystem disorder due to systemic inflammation and cytokine storm. Definitive cause of acute or late onset of inflammation, infection in various organs, and host response to emerging variants lacks clarity and needs elucidation.

Pre-existing liver and GI diseases are also highly predominant in the population, which can alter COVID-19 outcome due to altered immune status and host response. We aim to review the emerging variants of SARS-CoV2 and host response in patients with pre-existing liver and GI diseases.

400	10.3389/fimmu.2021.720205	Patients with the monogenic immune dysregulatory syndrome autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene, uniformly carry neutralizing autoantibodies directed against type-I interferons (IFNs) and many develop autoimmune pneumonitis, both of which place them at high risk for life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and block entry of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. The use of bamlanivimab and etesevimab early during infection was associated with reduced COVID-19–associated hospitalization and death in patients at high risk for progressing to severe disease, which led the US Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for their administration in non-hypoxemic, non-hospitalized high-risk patients. However, the safety and efficacy of these mAbs has not been evaluated in APECED patients. We enrolled two siblings with APECED on an IRB-approved protocol (NCT01386437) and admitted them prophylactically at the NIH Clinical Center for evaluation of mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We assessed the safety and clinical effects of early treatment with bamlanivimab and etesevimab. The administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab was well tolerated and was associated with amelioration of COVID-19 symptoms and prevention of invasive ventilatory support, admission to the intensive care, and death in both patients without affecting the production of antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. If given early in the course of COVID-19 infection, bamlanivimab and etesevimab may be beneficial in APECED and other high-risk patients with neutralizing autoantibodies directed against type-I IFNs.	mutation_name:  | effect_list: 
401	10.3389/fimmu.2021.751778	During the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged and spread worldwide. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was first reported in India in October 2020 and was classified as a “variant of concern (VOC)” by the WHO on 11 May, 2021. Compared to the wild-type strain, several studies have shown that the Delta variant is more transmissible and has higher viral loads in infected samples. COVID-19 patients infected with the Delta variant have a higher risk of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. The Delta variant is becoming the dominant strain in many countries around the world. This review summarizes and analyses the biological characteristics of key amino acid mutations, the epidemic characteristics, and the immune escape of the Delta variant.

402	10.3389/fimmu.2021.752003	The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants have become a major concern in the containment of current pandemic. The variants, including B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta) have shown reduced sensitivity to monoclonal antibodies, plasma and/or sera obtained from convalescent patients and vaccinated individuals. Development of potent therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with broad neutralizing breadth have become a priority for alleviating the devastating effects of this pandemic. Here, we review some of the most promising broadly neutralizing antibodies obtained from plasma of patients that recovered from early variants of SARS-CoV-2 that may be effective against emerging new variants of the virus. This review summarizes several mAbs, that have been discovered to cross-neutralize across Sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 escape mutants. Understanding the characteristics that confer this broad and cross-neutralization functions of these mAbs would inform on the development of therapeutic antibodies and guide the discovery of second-generation vaccines.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera, sensitivity_to_antibodies, sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera

406	10.3389/fimmu.2021.757197	The recent identification and rise to dominance of the P.1 and B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variants have brought international concern because they may confer fitness advantages. The same three positions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) are affected in both variants, but where the 417 substitution differs, the E484K/N501Y have co-evolved by convergent evolution. Here we characterize the functional and immune evasive consequences of the P.1 and B.1.351 RBD mutations. E484K and N501Y result in gain-of-function with two different outcomes: The N501Y confers a ten-fold affinity increase towards ACE-2, but a modest antibody evasion potential of plasma from convalescent or vaccinated individuals, whereas the E484K displays a significant antibody evasion capacity without a major impact on affinity. On the other hand, the two different 417 substitutions severely impair the RBD/ACE-2 affinity, but in the combined P.1 and B.1.351 RBD variants, this effect is partly counterbalanced by the effect of the E484K and N501Y. Our results suggest that the combination of these three mutations is a two-step forward and one step back in terms of viral fitness.	mutation_name: B.1.351 | effect_list: viral_fitness, binding_to_host_receptor

410	10.3389/fimmu.2022.836232	The continuous emergence of SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants, especially the variants of concern (VOC), exacerbated the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As the key of viral entry into host cells, the spike (S) protein is the major target of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies elicited by infection or vaccination. However, the mutations of S protein in variants may change the infectivity and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2, leading to the immune escape from those neutralizing antibodies. To characterize the mutations of S protein in newly emerging variants, the proteolytic property and binding affinity with receptor were assessed, and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudovirus system was used to assess the infectivity and immune escape. We found that some SARS-CoV-2 variants have changed significantly in viral infectivity; especially, B.1.617.2 is more likely to infect less susceptible cells than D614G, and the virus infection process can be completed in a shorter time. In addition, neutralizing mAbs and vaccinated sera partially or completely failed to inhibit host cell entry mediated by the S protein of certain SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, SARS-CoV-2 variant S protein-mediated viral infection can still be blocked by protease inhibitors and endocytosis inhibitors. This work provides a deeper understanding of the rise and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants and their immune evasion.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect_list: infectivity
411	10.3389/fmolb.2021.614443	The emergence of novel coronavirus mutants is a main factor behind the deterioration of the epidemic situation. Further studies into the pathogenicity of these mutants are thus urgently needed. Binding of the spinous protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor was shown to initiate coronavirus entry into host cells and lead to their infection. The receptor-binding motif (RBM, 438–506) is a region that directly interacts with ACE2 receptor in the RBD and plays a crucial role in determining affinity. To unravel how mutations in the non-RBM regions impact the interaction between RBD and ACE2, we selected three non-RBM mutant systems (N354D, D364Y, and V367F) from the documented clinical cases, and the Q498A mutant system located in the RBM region served as the control. Molecular dynamics simulation was conducted on the mutant systems and the wild-type (WT) system, and verified experiments also performed. Non-RBM mutations have been shown not only to change conformation of the RBM region but also to significantly influence its hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In particular, the D364Y and V367F systems showed a higher affinity for ACE2 owing to their electrostatic interactions and polar solvation energy changes. In addition, although the binding free energy at this point increased after the mutation of N354D, the conformation of the random coil (Pro384-Asp389) was looser than that of other systems, and the combined effect weakened the binding free energy between RBD and ACE2. Interestingly, we also found a random coil (Ala475-Gly485). This random coil is very sensitive to mutations, and both types of mutations increase the binding free energy of residues in this region. We found that the binding loop (Tyr495-Tyr505) in the RBD domain strongly binds to Lys353, an important residue of the ACE2 domain previously identified. The binding free energy of the non-RBM mutant group at the binding loop had positive and negative changes, and these changes were more obvious than that of the Q498A system. The results of this study elucidate the effect of non-RBM mutation on ACE2-RBD binding, and provide new insights for SARS-CoV-2 mutation research.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D364Y | effect_list: protein_conformational_optimization, intermolecular_interactions, binding_to_host_receptor

414	10.3389/fphar.2021.755600	Repurposing of currently available drugs is a valuable strategy to tackle the consequences of COVID-19. Recently, several studies have investigated the effect of psychoactive drugs on SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models as well as in clinical practice. Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants. Several antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2. Several clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the B.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine, known as anesthetic at high doses, and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudoviruses with common receptor binding domain mutations, N501Y, K417N, and E484K, as well as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2.

Our aim was to expand these studies and test some of these compounds against newly emerged variants. Several antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs with different primary mechanisms of action were tested in ACE2/TMPRSS2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells against the infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-dependent pseudoviruses. Some of these compounds were also tested in human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-1, against the first wave (B.1) lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and the variants of concern, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2. Several clinically used antidepressants, including fluoxetine, citalopram, reboxetine, imipramine, as well as antipsychotic compounds chlorpromazine, flupenthixol, and pimozide inhibited the infection by pseudotyped viruses with minimal effects on cell viability. The antiviral action of several of these drugs was verified in Calu-1 cells against the B.1 lineage of SARS-CoV-2. By contrast, the anticonvulsant carbamazepine, and novel antidepressants ketamine, known as anesthetic at high doses, and its derivatives as well as MAO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors phenelzine and rolipram, respectively, showed no activity in the pseudovirus model. Furthermore, fluoxetine remained effective against pseudoviruses with common receptor binding domain mutations, N501Y, K417N, and E484K, as well as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and B.1.617.2 (delta) variants of SARS-CoV-2.

422	10.3390/biom11070919	SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein is the target for the antiviral drug Remdesivir (RDV). With RDV clinical trials on COVID-19 patients showing a reduced hospitalisation time. During the spread of the virus, the RdRp has developed several mutations, with the most frequent being A97V and P323L. The current study sought to investigate whether A97V and P323L mutations influence the binding of RDV to the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 compared to wild-type (WT). The interaction of RDV with WT-, A97V-, and P323L-RdRp were measured using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and the free binding energies were extracted. Results showed that RDV that bound to WT- and A97V-RdRp had a similar dynamic motion and internal residue fluctuations, whereas RDV interaction with P323L-RdRp exhibited a tighter molecular conformation, with a high internal motion near the active site. This was further corroborated with RDV showing a higher binding affinity to P323L-RdRp (−24.1 kcal/mol) in comparison to WT-RdRp (−17.3 kcal/mol). This study provides insight into the potential significance of administering RDV to patients carrying the SARS-CoV-2 P323L-RdRp mutation, which may have a more favourable chance of alleviating the SARS-CoV-2 illness in comparison to WT-RdRp carriers, thereby suggesting further scientific consensus for the usage of Remdesivir as clinical candidate against COVID-19.	mutation_name: NSP12_A97V | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs

424	10.3390/biom11091273	The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mediates the viral–host interaction and is a target for most neutralizing antibodies. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations pose a threat due to their role in host cell entry via the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor that might strengthen SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, viral load, or resistance against neutralizing antibodies. To understand the molecular structural link between RBD mutations and infectivity, the top five mutant RBDs (i.e., N501Y, E484K L452R, S477N, and N439K) were selected based on their recorded case numbers. These mutants along with wild-type (WT) RBD were studied through all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 100 ns. The principal component analysis and the free energy landscape were used too. Interestingly, N501Y, N439K, and E484K mutations were observed to increase the rigidity in some RBD regions while increasing the flexibility of the receptor-binding motif (RBM) region, suggesting a compensation of the entropy penalty. However, S477N and L452R RBDs were observed to increase the flexibility of the RBM region while maintaining similar flexibility in other RBD regions in comparison to WT RBD. Therefore, both mutations (especially S477N) might destabilize the RBD structure, as loose conformation compactness was observed. The destabilizing effect of S477N RBD was consistent with previous work on S477N mutation. Finally, the free energy landscape results showed that mutations changed WT RBD conformation while local minima were maintained for all mutant RBDs. In conclusion, RBD mutations definitely impact the WT RBD structure and conformation as well as increase the binding affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect_list: protein_flexibility, protein_flexibility, protein_conformational_optimization, binding_to_host_receptor

429	10.3390/biom11101494	Among the more recently identified SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest (VOI) is the Lambda variant, which emerged in Peru and has rapidly spread to South American regions and the US. This variant remains poorly investigated, particularly regarding the effects of mutations on the thermodynamic parameters affecting the stability of the Spike protein and its Receptor Binding Domain. We report here an in silico study on the potential impact of the Spike protein mutations on the immuno-escape ability of the Lambda variant. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that a combination of shortening the immunogenic epitope loops and the generation of potential N-glycosylation sites may be a viable adaptation strategy, potentially allowing this emerging viral variant to escape from host immunity.	mutation_name: LAMBDA | effect_list: immune_escape, protein_conformational_optimization, protein_stability

However, the molecular consequences of mutations within B.1.1.7 on spike protein dynamics and stability or ACE2 binding are largely unknown. Here, molecular dynamics simulations comparing SARS-CoV-2 wild type with the B.1.1.7 variant revealed inter-trimeric contact rearrangements, altering the structural flexibility within the spike protein trimer. Furthermore, we found increased flexibility in direct spatial proximity of the fusion peptide due to salt bridge rearrangements induced by the D614G mutation in B.1.1.7. This study also implies a reduced binding affinity for B.1.1.7 with ACE2, as the N501Y mutation restructures the RBD–ACE2 interface, significantly decreasing the linear interaction energy between the RBD and ACE2.

434	10.3390/ijerph19031127	Few studies have assessed incubation periods of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Delta variant. This study aimed to elucidate the transmission dynamics, especially the incubation period, for the Delta variant compared with non-Delta strains. We studied unvaccinated coronavirus disease 2019 patients with definite single exposure date from August 2020 to September 2021 in Japan. The incubation periods were calculated and compared by Mann–Whitney U test for Delta (with L452R mutation) and non-Delta cases. We estimated mean and percentiles of incubation period by fitting parametric distribution to data in the Bayesian statistical framework. We enrolled 214 patients (121 Delta and 103 non-Delta cases) with one specific date of exposure to the virus. The mean incubation period was 3.7 days and 4.9 days for Delta and non-Delta cases, respectively (p-value = 0.000). When lognormal distributions were fitted, the estimated mean incubation periods were 3.7 (95% credible interval (CI) 3.4–4.0) and 5.0 (95% CI 4.5–5.6) days for Delta and non-Delta cases, respectively. The estimated 97.5th percentile of incubation period was 6.9 (95% CI 5.9–8.0) days and 10.4 (95% CI 8.6–12.7) days for Delta and non–Delta cases, respectively.

435	10.3390/ijms22115464	The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Currently, most of the research efforts towards the development of vaccines and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were mainly focused on the spike (S) protein, which mediates virus entry into the host cell by binding to ACE2. As the virus SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, variants have emerged, characterized by multiple mutations of the S glycoprotein. Herein, we employed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of the mutations of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 (B.1.1.7), termed the “UK variant”, in comparison with the wild type, with the aim to decipher the structural basis of the reported increased infectivity and virulence. The simulations provided insights on the different dynamics of UK and wild-type S glycoprotein, regarding in particular the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). In addition, we investigated the role of glycans in modulating the conformational transitions of the RBD. The overall results showed that the UK mutant experiences higher flexibility in the RBD with respect to wild type; this behavior might be correlated with the increased transmission reported for this variant. Our work also adds useful structural information on antigenic “hotspots” and epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: infectivity, viral_virulence, protein_flexibility, viral_transmission

The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT.

439	10.3390/ijms22179131	The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak in December 2019 has caused a global pandemic. The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT.

This study describes a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from a 53-year-old woman from Apulia (Italy), who was COVID-19 positive for approximately four months. In this paper we aimed to investigate any potential correlation between genetic mutations and clinical features of this case of infection. The viral isolate was assigned to lineage B.1.177.51 through whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and harbored a novel set of mutations on the Spike protein (V143D, del144/145 and E484K); furthermore, seroneutralization assays showed impaired response of the surveyed strain to BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine-induced (average reduction of 70%) and convalescent sera (average reduction of 19.04%), when compared to VOC P.1. This study highlights the importance of genomic surveillance for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, the relevance of monitoring of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations in all lineages, and the necessity of testing the response of emerging variants to available therapies and vaccines.	mutation_name: B.1.177.51 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera

Recently reported mutations in the spike glycoprotein unique to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of different variants might increase the binding and pathogenesis. However, it is still not known how these mutations affect the binding of RBD to GRP78. The current study provides a structural basis for the binding of GRP78 to the different variants, i.e., B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617, and P.1 (spike RBD), of SARS-CoV-2 using a biomolecular simulation approach. Docking results showed that the new variants bound stronger than the wild-type, which was further confirmed through the free energy calculation results. All-atom simulation confirmed structural stability, which was consistent with previous results by following the global stability trend. We concluded that the increased binding affinity of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants was due to a variation in the bonding network that helped the virus induce a higher infectivity and disease severity. Consequently, we reported that the aforementioned new variants use GRP78 as an alternate receptor to enhance their seriousness.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: host_virus_interactions, intermolecular_interactions, infectivity, disease_severity

The aim of the present study was to monitor the changes in genetic diversity and track non-synonymous substitutions (dN) that could be implicated in the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 and its spread in different regions between December 2019 and November 2020. We analyzed 2213 complete genomes from six geographical regions worldwide, which were downloaded from GenBank and GISAID databases. Although SARS-CoV-2 presented low genetic diversity, there has been an increase over time, with the presence of several hotspot mutations throughout its genome. We identified seven frequent mutations that resulted in dN substitutions. Two of them, C14408T>P323L and A23403G>D614G, located in the nsp12 and Spike protein, respectively, emerged early in the pandemic and showed a considerable increase in frequency over time. Two other mutations, A1163T>I120F in nsp2 and G22992A>S477N in the Spike protein, emerged recently and have spread in Oceania and Europe.

The B.1.1.7 variant of SARS CoV-2 is reported to cause higher transmission. The study investigates the replication cycle and transcriptional pattern of the B.1.1.7 to hypothesis the possible role of different genes in viral replication. It was observed that the B.1.1.7 variant required a longer maturation time. The transcriptional response demonstrated higher expression of ORF6 and ORF8 compared to nucleocapsid transcript till the eclipse period which might influence higher viral replication. The number of infectious viruses titer is higher in the B.1.1.7, despite a lesser copy number than B.1, indicating higher transmissibility. The experimental evidence published linked ORF6 and ORF8 to play important role in replication and we also observed their higher expression. This leads us to hypothesis the possible role of ORF6 and ORF8 in B.1.1.7 higher replication which causes higher transmission.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission, viral_replication

The rapid lineage shift was accompanied by a significant increase of cases, resulting in one of the highest incidence rates worldwide. Comparative coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations indicated that T307I and D614G belong to a previously unrecognized dynamic domain, interfering with the mobility of the receptor binding domain of the spike. The T307I mutation showed a synergistic effect with the D614G.

The rapid lineage shift was accompanied by a significant increase of cases, resulting in one of the highest incidence rates worldwide. Comparative coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations indicated that T307I and D614G belong to a previously unrecognized dynamic domain, interfering with the mobility of the receptor binding domain of the spike. The T307I mutation showed a synergistic effect with the D614G. Continuous surveillance of new mutations and molecular analyses of such variations are important tools to understand the molecular mechanisms defining infectivity and virulence of current and future SARS-CoV-2 strains.	mutation_name: P.1 | effect_list: infectivity, viral_virulence

462	10.3390/v13081514	SARS-CoV-2 spike is evolving to maximize transmissibility and evade the humoral response. The massive genomic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates has led to the identification of single-point mutations and deletions, often having the recurrence of hotspots, associated with advantageous phenotypes. We report the isolation and molecular characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 strain, belonging to a lineage (C.36) not previously associated with concerning traits, which shows decreased susceptibility to vaccine sera neutralization.	mutation_name: C.36 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera

Here, we compared B.1.617 variants for neutralization resistance by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 pseudoviruses showed a modest 1.5- to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 pseudoviruses, but 7- and 16-fold reductions for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, were seen for B.1.351 pseudoviruses. Among twenty-three therapeutic antibodies tested, four antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses and six antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 and AY.1 pseudoviruses. Our results indicate that the current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants. Finally, the P681R substitution confers efficient cleavage of B.1.617 variants’ spike proteins and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.	mutation_name: AY.1 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera, sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines

474	10.3390/v14020172	The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten healthcare systems worldwide due to the limited access to vaccines, suboptimal treatment options, and the continuous emergence of new and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Reverse-genetics studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes, green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated substitutions F480L and V570L—and naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and N491S, all in nsp12—did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient non-infectious subgenomic replicon system. The developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse-genetics systems, including recombinants to modify infectious viruses and non-infectious subgenomic replicons with autonomous genomic RNA replication, will permit high-throughput cell culture studies—providing fundamental understanding of basic biology of this coronavirus. We have proven the utility of the systems in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing and variant screening were assessed by using Thermo Fisher(®) TaqPath™ COVID-19 and ID solutions(®) ID™ SARS-CoV-2/VOC evolution Pentaplex assays. Delta SARS-CoV-2 infections were associated with higher VL than Alpha (coef = 0.68; p ≤ 0.01) independently of patient’s vaccination status, symptoms, age and sex. This difference was higher for patients diagnosed late after symptom onset (coef = 0.88; p = 0.01) than for those diagnosed early (coef = 0.43; p = 0.03). Infections in vaccinated patients were associated with lower VL (coef = −0.18; p ≤ 0.01) independently of virus variant, symptom, age and sex. Our results suggest that Delta infections could lead to higher VL and for a longer period compared to Alpha infections. By effectively reducing the NP VL, vaccination could allow for limiting viral spread, even with the Delta variant.	mutation_name: ALPHA | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_vaccines

481	10.3390/v14030545	Omicron is the most mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant—a factor that can affect transmissibility, disease severity, and immune evasiveness. Its genomic surveillance is important in cities with millions of inhabitants and an economic center, such as Mexico City. Results. From 16 November to 31 December 2021, we observed an increase of 88% in Omicron prevalence in Mexico City. We explored the R346K substitution, prevalent in 42% of Omicron variants, known to be associated with immune escape by monoclonal antibodies. In a phylogenetic analysis, we found several independent exchanges between Mexico and the world, and there was an event followed by local transmission that gave rise to most of the Omicron diversity in Mexico City. A haplotype analysis revealed that there was no association between haplotype and vaccination status. Among the 66% of patients who have been vaccinated, no reported comorbidities were associated with Omicron; the presence of odynophagia and the absence of dysgeusia were significant predictor symptoms for Omicron, and the RT-qPCR Ct values were lower for Omicron. Conclusions. Genomic surveillance is key to detecting the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in a timely manner, even weeks before the onset of an infection wave, and can inform public health decisions and detect the spread of any mutation that may affect therapeutic efficacy.	mutation_name: OMICRON | effect_list: viral_transmission, disease_severity, immune_escape, ct_value

483	10.3390/v14030650	There is a growing interest in using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the early stages of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to prevent disease progression. Little is known about the efficacy of mAbs against the delta variant of concern and its clinical presentations. We evaluated the effect of casirivimab/imdevimab treatment among five delta vaccine breakthrough patients. Symptomatic non-hospitalized vaccinated patients were submitted to nasopharyngeal swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Blood analysis and chest Computed Tomography were also performed. A cocktail of casirivimab/imdevimab was administrated, and patients were monitored weekly. Clinical evolution was evaluated by the regression of the symptoms, negative results by real-time RT-PCR, and by the need of hospitalization: these aspects were considered as significant outcomes. In four cases, symptom reversion and viral load reduction were observed within 2 days and 7 days after mAbs treatment, respectively. Only one case, suffering from thymoma, was hospitalized 2 days later because of respiratory failure, which reverted within 18 days. mAbs treatment seems to be safe and effective against the delta variant and its clinical manifestations.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs
484	10.3390/vaccines9060616	The routine detection, surveillance, and reporting of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial, as these threaten to hinder global vaccination efforts. Herein we report a novel local variant with a non-synonymous mutation in the spike (S) protein P681H. This local Israeli variant was not associated with a higher infection rate or higher prevalence. Furthermore, the local variant was successfully neutralized by sera from fully vaccinated individuals at a comparable level to the B.1.1.7 variant and an Israel wild-type strain. While it is not a variant of concern, routine monitoring by sequencing is still required.	mutation_name: SPIKE_P681H | effect_list: viral_transmission, sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera
485	10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20211118-00899	Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 epidemic in Ejina banner, Inner Mongolia, in October 2021 and provide evidence for the improvement of COVID-19 prevention and control. Methods: The information about the time, area and population distributions of COVID-19 cases in Ejina before November 13, 2021 and the gene sequencing result of the isolates were collected for a statistical descriptive analysis. Results: The first COVID-19 case in Ejina occurred on 7 October, 2021. A total of 164 COVID-19 cases were reported from October 19 to November 12. Most cases were distributed in 6 communities in Darahub (156 cases, 95.12%). The result of full gene sequencing of the isolates indicted that the pathogen was Delta variant (B.1.617.2). The male to female ratio of the cases was 1.3â¶1. The age of cases ranged from 1 to 85 years, and the cases aged 20-59 years accounted for 78.66%. The main clinical symptoms were sore throat (91 cases, 91.92%), cough (49 cases, 49.49%) and fever (23 cases, 23.23%). Most cases were ordinary ones (81 cases, 49.39%) and mild ones (68 cases, 41.46%). The cases were mainly detected at the isolation points (84 cases, 51.22%) and through population based nucleic acid testing (62 cases, 37.80%). The basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was 5.3, the average incubation period was 3.9 days. The local government rapidly started â £ level emergency response and conducted 10 rounds of nucleic acid tests. The transferring of travelers reduced the risk for the further spread of COVID-19 in Ejina. Conclusions: The epidemic of COVID-19 in Ejina characterized by strong transmission, short incubation period, herd susceptibility and case clustering. Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was the pathogen, which might be imported from Zeke port. Comprehensive prevention and control measures, such as closed-loop management and vaccination, should be continued. The successful transferring of the patients and travelers provided evidence for the effective and precise prevention and control of COVID-19 in a routine manner.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect_list: viral_incubation_period, viral_transmission
486	10.4414/smw.2022.w30133	BACKGROUND Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an important route of infection. For the wildtype (WT) only a small proportion of those infected emitted large quantities of the virus. The currently prevalent variants of concern, Delta (B1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529), are characterized by higher viral loads and a lower minimal infective dose compared to the WT. We aimed to describe the resulting distribution of airborne viral emissions and to reassess the risk estimates for public settings given the higher viral load and infectivity. METHOD We reran the Monte Carlo modelling to estimate viral emissions in the fine aerosol size range using available viral load data. We also updated our tool to simulate indoor airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by including a CO2 calculator and recirculating air cleaning devices. We also assessed the consequences of the lower critical dose on the infection risk in public settings with different protection strategies. RESULTS Our modelling suggests that a much larger proportion of individuals infected with the new variants are high, very high or super-emitters of airborne viruses: for the WT, one in 1,000 infected was a super-emitter; for Delta one in 30; and for Omicron one in 20 or one in 10, depending on the viral load estimate used. Testing of the effectiveness of protective strategies in view of the lower critical dose suggests that surgical masks are no longer sufficient in most public settings, while correctly fitted FFP2 respirators still provide sufficient protection, except in high aerosol producing situations such as singing or shouting. DISCUSSION From an aerosol transmission perspective, the shift towards a larger proportion of very high emitting individuals, together with the strongly reduced critical dose, seem to be two important drivers of the aerosol risk, and are likely contributing to the observed rapid spread of the Delta and Omicron variants of concern. Reducing contacts, always wearing well-fitted FFP2 respirators when indoors, using ventilation and other methods to reduce airborne virus concentrations, and avoiding situations with loud voices seem critical to limiting these latest waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.	mutation_name: B.1.1.529 | effect_list: viral_transmission, viral_load, infectivity

488	10.7150/ijbs.68973	Vaccines are proving to be highly effective in controlling hospitalization and deaths associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as shown by clinical trials and real-world evidence. However, a deadly second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), infected by SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, with an increased number of post-vaccination breakthrough infections were reported in the world recently. Actually, Delta variant not only resulted in a severe surge of vaccine breakthrough infections which was accompanied with high viral load and transmissibility, but also challenged the development of effective vaccines. Therefore, the biological characteristics and epidemiological profile of Delta variant, the current status of Delta variant vaccine breakthrough infections and the mechanism of vaccine breakthrough infections were discussed in this article. In addition, the significant role of the Delta variant spike (S) protein in the mechanism of immune escape of SARS-CoV-2 was highlighted in this article. In particular, we further discussed key points on the future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research and development, hoping to make a contribution to the early, accurate and rapid control of the COVID-19 epidemic.	mutation_name: B.1.617.2 | effect_list: viral_load, viral_transmission, immune_escape, effectiveness_of_available_vaccines
489	10.7326/m22-0308	BACKGROUND: At the end of 2021, the B.1.1.529 SARS-CoV-2 variant (Omicron) wave superseded the B.1.617.2 variant (Delta) wave. OBJECTIVE: To compare baseline characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with the Delta variant versus the Omicron variant in the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: Retrospective chart reviews. SETTING: 13 adult EDs in academic hospitals in the Paris area from 29 November 2021 to 10 January 2022. PATIENTS: Patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2 and variant identification. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome measures were baseline clinical and biological characteristics at ED presentation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 3728 patients had a positive RT-PCR test result for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period; 1716 patients who had a variant determination (818 Delta and 898 Omicron) were included. Median age was 58 years, and 49% were women. Patients infected with the Omicron variant were younger (54 vs. 62 years; difference, 8.0 years [95% CI, 4.6 to 11.4 years]), had a lower rate of obesity (8.0% vs. 12.5%; difference, 4.5 percentage points [CI, 1.5 to 7.5 percentage points]), were more vaccinated (65% vs. 39% for 1 dose and 22% vs. 11% for 3 doses), had a lower rate of dyspnea (26% vs. 50%; difference, 23.6 percentage points [CI, 19.0 to 28.2 percentage points]), and had a higher rate of discharge home from the ED (59% vs. 37%; difference, 21.9 percentage points [−26.5 to −17.1 percentage points]). Compared with Delta, Omicron infection was independently associated with a lower risk for ICU admission (adjusted difference, 11.4 percentage points [CI, 8.4 to 14.4 percentage points]), mechanical ventilation (adjusted difference, 3.6 percentage points [CI, 1.7 to 5.6 percentage points]), and in-hospital mortality (adjusted difference, 4.2 percentage points [CI, 2.0 to 6.5 percentage points]). LIMITATION: Patients with COVID-19 illness and no SARS-CoV-2 variant determination in the ED were excluded. CONCLUSION: Compared with the Delta variant, infection with the Omicron variant in patients in the ED had different clinical and biological patterns and was associated with better in-hospital outcomes, including higher survival.
