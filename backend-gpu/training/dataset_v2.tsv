0	10.1101/2020.11.10.20228528	We report the implementation of a two-step strategy for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the spike deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70). This spike deletion resulted in a S-gene target failure (SGTF) of a three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). Whole genome sequencing performed on 37 samples with SGTF revealed several receptor-binding domain mutations co-occurring with ΔH69/ΔV70. More importantly, this strategy enabled the first detection of the variant of concern 202012/01 in France on December 21th 2020.Since September a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70) has attracted increasing attention. This deletion was detected in the cluster-5 variant identified both in minks and humans in Denmark. This cluster-5 variant carries a receptor binding domain (RBD) mutation Y453F and was associated with reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies to sera from recovered COVID-19 patients [1–3]. The ΔH69/ΔV70 has also co-occurred with two other RBD mutations of increasing interest [4]: N439K that is currently spreading in Europe and might also have reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [5]; and N501Y that is part of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 recently detected in England [6]. Although the impact of ΔH69/ΔV70 on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is not clear, enhanced surveillance is urgently needed. Herein we report the implementation of a two-step strategy enabling a rapid detection of VOC 202012/01 or other variants carrying ΔH69/ΔV70.	mutation_name: SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70- | effect: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics | level: lower
1	10.2807/1560-7917.es.2021.26.3.2100008	We report the strategy leading to the first detection of variant of concern 202012/01 (VOC) in France (21 December 2020). First, the spike (S) deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70), identified in certain SARS-CoV-2 variants including VOC, is screened for. This deletion is associated with a S-gene target failure (SGTF) in the three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). Subsequently, SGTF samples are whole genome sequenced. This approach revealed mutations co-occurring with ΔH69/ΔV70 including S:N501Y in the VOC.	mutation_name: SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70- | effect: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics | level: lower
2	10.2147/idr.s320658	There is a concern that the spread of mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 will increase the number of severe COVID-19 patients and weaken vaccine effectiveness in the world. The mutants of the spike region of SARS-CoV-2, such as N501Y, E484K, P681H, and deletion H69/V70 (del 69/70), were studied in 25 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 2020 to April 2021; there were no patients with N501Y and P681H, but nine patients had E484K alone. Their symptoms, laboratory data, and course of their disease were similar to those of the other patients with the non-mutant virus. One patient with del69/70 alone showed prolonged inflammation, viral excretion, and late exacerbation 18 days after onset. Del69/70 may be independently associated with evasion of immunity, as previously reported, and it is present in Japan.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect: disease_severity | level: unaffected

5	10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109292	We report SARS-CoV-2 spike ΔH69/V70 in multiple independent lineages, often occurring after acquisition of the receptor binding motif replacements such as N439K and Y453F known to increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and confer antibody escape. In vitro, we show that whilst ΔH69/V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism, it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions. ΔH69/V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of S proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation. In addition, replacement of H69 and V70 residues in B.1.1.7 spike (where ΔH69/V70 naturally occurs) impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus. B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild type Wuhan-1 D614G, dependent on ΔH69/V70. Therefore, as ΔH69/V70 compensates for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity, continued surveillance for deletions with functional effects is warranted.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N439K | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

12	10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102715	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly evolving in the form of new variants. At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (≥20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (≥20 %) than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.	mutation_name: AY.1 | effect: binding_to_abs | level: lower

14	10.1101/2021.02.14.431043	Wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is critical to tracking viral evolution during the ongoing pandemic. Variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil have spread to multiple countries. We developed the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detected an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020 when it represented <1% of sequenced coronavirus genomes that were collected in New York City (NYC). By February 2021, genomes from this lineage accounted for ~32% of 3288 sequenced genomes from NYC specimens. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage in NYC, notably the sub-clade defined by the spike mutation E484K, which has outpaced the growth of other variants in NYC. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, indicating the public health importance of this lineage.	mutation_name: B.1.526 | effect: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera | level: lower

17	10.1056/nejmoa2105000	Summary Emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of clinical concern. In a cohort of 417 persons who had received the second dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine at least 2 weeks previously, we identified 2 women with vaccine breakthrough infection. Despite evidence of vaccine efficacy in both women, symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 developed, and they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase-chain-reaction testing. Viral sequencing revealed variants of likely clinical importance, including E484K in 1 woman and three mutations (T95I, del142–144, and D614G) in both. These observations indicate a potential risk of illness after successful vaccination and subsequent infection with variant virus, and they provide support for continued efforts to prevent and diagnose infection and to characterize variants in vaccinated persons.

19	10.1101/2021.09.12.21263475	The significantly greater infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants of concern (VOC) is hypothesized to be driven by key mutations that result in increased transmissibility, viral load and/or evasion of host immune response. We surveyed the mutational profiles of Delta VOC genomes between September 2020 and mid-August 2021 and identified a previously unreported mutation pattern at amino acid position 142 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein which demonstrated multiple rounds of mutation from G142 to D142 and back. This pattern of frequent back mutations was observed at multiple time points and across Delta VOC sub-lineages. The etiology for these recurrent mutations is unclear but raises the possibility of host-directed editing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Within Delta VOC this mutation is associated with higher viral load, further enhanced in the presence of another NTD mutation (T95I) which was also frequently observed in these cases. Protein modeling of both mutations predicts alterations of the surface topography of the NTD by G142D, specifically disturbance of the 'super site' epitope that binds NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). The appearance of frequent and repeated G142D followed by D142G back mutations is previously unreported in SARS-CoV-2 and may represent viral adaptation to evolving host immunity characterized by increasing frequency of spike NAbs, from both prior infection and vaccine-based immunity. The emergence of alterations of the NTD in and around the main NAb epitope is a concerning development in the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to increased infectivity, immune evasion and 'breakthrough infections' characteristic of Delta VOC. Future vaccine and therapy development may benefit by recognizing the emergence of these novel spike NTD mutations and considering their impact on antibody recognition, viral neutralization, infectivity, replication, and viral load.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

The appearance of frequent and repeated G142D followed by D142G back mutations is previously unreported in SARS-CoV-2 and may represent viral adaptation to evolving host immunity characterized by increasing frequency of spike NAbs, from both prior infection and vaccine-based immunity. The emergence of alterations of the NTD in and around the main NAb epitope is a concerning development in the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to increased infectivity, immune evasion and 'breakthrough infections' characteristic of Delta VOC.

25	10.1101/2021.06.16.21259017	Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean, has had a unique experience of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In March 2020, Mauritius endured a small first wave and quickly implemented control measures which allowed elimination of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. When borders to the island reopened, it was accompanied by mandatory quarantine and testing of incoming passengers to avoid reintroduction of the virus into the community. As variants of concern (VOCs) emerged elsewhere in the world, Mauritius began using genomic surveillance to keep track of quarantined cases of these variants. In March 2021, another local outbreak occurred, and sequencing was used to investigate this new wave of local infections. Here, we analyze 154 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Mauritius, which represent 12% of all the infections seem in Mauritius, these were both from specimens of incoming passengers before March 2021 and those of cases during the second wave. Our findings indicate that despite the presence of known VOCs Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) among quarantined passengers, the second wave of local SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mauritius was caused by a single introduction and dominant circulation of the B.1.1.318 virus. The B.1.1.318 variant is characterized by fourteen non-synonymous mutations in the S-gene, with five encoded amino acid substitutions (T95I, E484K, D614G, P681H, D796H) and one deletion (Y144del) in the Spike glycoprotein. This variant seems to be increasing in prevalence and it is now present in 34 countries. This study highlights that despite having stopped the introduction of more transmissible VOCs by travel quarantines, a single undetected introduction of a B.1.1.318 lineage virus was enough to initiate a large local outbreak in Mauritius and demonstrated the need for continuous genomic surveillance to fully inform public health decisions.	mutation_name: B.1.1.318 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

In the backdrop of the global emergence of “variants of concern” (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617 possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in the furin cleavage site, revealed that these may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better transmissibility. The same two RBD mutations indicated decreased binding to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization potential. Experimental validation against a wider panel of mAbs, sera from vaccinees and those that recovered from natural infection needs to be studied.

31	10.21203/rs.3.rs-753550/v1	Airborne transmission, a term combining both large droplet and aerosol transmission, is thought to be the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher
32	10.7554/elife.65365	A novel variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on wild-type human-codon-optimized Spike to introduce the D614G variant. Using multiple human cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, we found that the lentiviral particles pseudotyped with Spike D614G are more effective at transducing cells than ones pseudotyped with wild-type Spike. The increased transduction with Spike D614G ranged from 1.3- to 2.4-fold in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells expressing endogenous ACE2 and from 1.5- to 7.7-fold in A549ACE2 and Huh7.5ACE2 overexpressing ACE2. Furthermore, trans-complementation of SARS-CoV-2 virus with Spike D614G showed an increased infectivity in human cells. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the D614 and G614 Spike variants, the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect: infectivity | level: higher

40	10.1101/2020.10.23.20218511	Abstract Background We aimed to further characterize and analyze in depth intra-host variation and founder variants of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide up until August 2020, by examining in excess of 94,000 SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences in order to understand SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution, how these variants arose and identify any increased mortality associated with these variants. Methods and Findings We combined worldwide sequencing data from GISAID and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repositories and discovered SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation occurring in less than 2% of COVID19 patients, likely caused by host mechanisms involved APOBEC3G complexes and intra-host microdiversity. Most of this intra-host variation occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to change viral proteins with defined variant signatures, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be actively shaped by the host immune system to varying degrees. At the global population level, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Nsp2, 3C-like proteinase, ORF3a and ORF8 are under active evolution, as evidenced by their increased πN/πS ratios per geographical region. Importantly, two emergent variants: V1176F in co-occurrence with D614G mutation in the viral Spike protein, and S477N, located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, are associated with high fatality rates and are increasingly spreading throughout the world. The S477N variant arose quickly in Australia and experimental data support that this variant increases Spike protein fitness and its binding to ACE2. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 is evolving non-randomly, and human hosts shape emergent variants with positive fitness that can easily spread into the population. We propose that V1776F and S477N variants occurring in the Spike protein are two novel mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 and may pose significant public health concerns in the future.	mutation_name: SPIKE_V1176F+SPIKE_D614G | effect: fatality_rate | level: higher

46	10.1016/j.jmb.2021.167051	The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are structurally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S477N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (∼40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N440K | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S477N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (∼40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.	mutation_name: SPIKE_N501Y+SPIKE_E484K | effect: binding_to_host_receptor | level: higher

However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in ≥0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in ≥0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition.

59	10.1101/2020.12.14.422555	SARS-CoV-2 amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain (RBD) occur relatively frequently and some have a consequence for immune recognition. Here we report recurrent emergence and significant onward transmission of a six-nucleotide out of frame deletion in the S gene, which results in loss of two amino acids: H69 and V70. We report that in human infections ΔH69/V70 often co-occurs with the receptor binding motif amino acid replacements N501Y, N439K and Y453F, and in the latter two cases has followed the RBD mutation. One of the ΔH69/V70+ N501Y lineages, now known as B.1.1.7, has undergone rapid expansion and includes eight S gene mutations: RBD (N501Y and A570D), S1 (ΔH69/V70 and Δ144) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H). In vitro, we show that ΔH69/V70 does not reduce serum neutralisation across multiple convalescent sera. However, ΔH69/V70 increases infectivity and is associated with increased incorporation of cleaved spike into virions. ΔH69/V70 is able to compensate for small infectivity defects induced by RBD mutations N501Y, N439K and Y453F. In addition, replacement of H69 and V70 residues in the B.1.1.7 spike reduces its infectivity and spike mediated cell-cell fusion. Based on our data ΔH69/V70 likely acts as a permissive mutation that allows acquisition of otherwise deleterious immune escape mutations. Enhanced surveillance for the ΔH69/V70 deletion with and without RBD mutations should be considered as a global priority not only as a marker for the B.1.1.7 variant, but potentially also for other emerging variants of concern. Vaccines designed to target the deleted spike protein could mitigate against its emergence as increased selective forces from immunity and vaccines increase globally. Highlights ΔH69/V70 is present in at least 28 SARS-CoV-2 lineages ΔH69/V70 does not confer escape from convalescent sera ΔH69/V70 increases spike infectivity and compensates for RBD mutations ΔH69/V70 is associated with greater spike cleavage B.1.1.7 requires ΔH69/V70 for optimal spike cleavage and infectivity	mutation_name: SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70- | effect: infectivity | level: higher

65	10.1101/2021.06.04.21258333	In early 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 became dominant across large parts of the world. In Denmark, comprehensive and real-time test, contact-tracing, and sequencing efforts were applied to sustain epidemic control. Here, we use these data to investigate the transmissibility, introduction, and onward transmission of B.1.1.7 in Denmark. In a period with stable restrictions, we estimated an increased B.1.1.7 transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%,60%]) relative to other lineages. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that 37% of B.1.1.7 cases were related to the initial introduction in November 2020. Continuous introductions contributed substantially to case numbers, highlighting the benefit of balanced travel restrictions and self-isolation procedures coupled with comprehensive surveillance efforts, to sustain epidemic control in the face of emerging variants.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher
66	10.1101/2021.07.26.453518	Airborne transmission, a term combining both large droplet and aerosol transmission, is thought to be the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect: viral_transmission | level: higher

We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 varied by state, the variant increased at a logistic rate with a roughly weekly doubling rate and an increased transmission of 40-50%. We revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with community transmission spreading it to most states within months.

We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021.

This results in significantly improved initial virus [[EQUATION]] cell molecular recognition and attachment at the microscopic level, which trigger the infectious cycle.	mutation_name_list: B.1.160,B.1.1.7,B.1.351,P.1,P.2
1	10.1016/j.antiviral.2021.105033	Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in ≥0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in ≥0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.	mutation_name_list: NSP12_P323L
2	10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.052	The highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in the United Kingdom, has gained a foothold across the world. Using S gene target failure (SGTF) and SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing, we investigated the prevalence and dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 varied by state, the variant increased at a logistic rate with a roughly weekly doubling rate and an increased transmission of 40-50%. We revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with community transmission spreading it to most states within months.

3	10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109292	We report SARS-CoV-2 spike ΔH69/V70 in multiple independent lineages, often occurring after acquisition of the receptor binding motif replacements such as N439K and Y453F known to increase binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor and confer antibody escape. In vitro, we show that whilst ΔH69/V70 itself is not an antibody evasion mechanism, it increases infectivity associated with enhanced incorporation of cleaved spike into virions. ΔH69/V70 is able to partially rescue infectivity of S proteins that have acquired N439K and Y453F escape mutations by increased spike incorporation. In addition, replacement of H69 and V70 residues in B.1.1.7 spike (where ΔH69/V70 naturally occurs) impairs spike incorporation and entry efficiency of B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped virus. B.1.1.7 spike mediates faster kinetics of cell-cell fusion than wild type Wuhan-1 D614G, dependent on ΔH69/V70. Therefore, as ΔH69/V70 compensates for immune escape mutations that impair infectivity, continued surveillance for deletions with functional effects is warranted.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N439K,SPIKE_Y453F,SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70-,B.1.1.7
4	10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102715	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly evolving in the form of new variants. At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (≥20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (≥20 %) than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.	mutation_name_list: AY.1
5	10.1016/j.jmb.2021.167051	The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are structurally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S477N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (∼40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_N440K,SPIKE_S443A,SPIKE_G476S,SPIKE_E484R,SPIKE_G502P,SPIKE_S477N,SPIKE_E484K,SPIKE_N501Y,SPIKE_S477N+SPIKE_E484K,SPIKE_N501Y+SPIKE_E484K,SPIKE_E484K+SPIKE_K417T+SPIKE_N501Y

In a cohort of 417 persons who had received the second dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine at least 2 weeks previously, we identified 2 women with vaccine breakthrough infection. Despite evidence of vaccine efficacy in both women, symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 developed, and they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase-chain-reaction testing. Viral sequencing revealed variants of likely clinical importance, including E484K in 1 woman and three mutations (T95I, del142–144, and D614G) in both. These observations indicate a potential risk of illness after successful vaccination and subsequent infection with variant virus, and they provide support for continued efforts to prevent and diagnose infection and to characterize variants in vaccinated persons.

8	10.1101/2020.10.23.20218511	Abstract Background We aimed to further characterize and analyze in depth intra-host variation and founder variants of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide up until August 2020, by examining in excess of 94,000 SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences in order to understand SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution, how these variants arose and identify any increased mortality associated with these variants. Methods and Findings We combined worldwide sequencing data from GISAID and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repositories and discovered SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation occurring in less than 2% of COVID19 patients, likely caused by host mechanisms involved APOBEC3G complexes and intra-host microdiversity. Most of this intra-host variation occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to change viral proteins with defined variant signatures, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be actively shaped by the host immune system to varying degrees. At the global population level, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Nsp2, 3C-like proteinase, ORF3a and ORF8 are under active evolution, as evidenced by their increased πN/πS ratios per geographical region. Importantly, two emergent variants: V1176F in co-occurrence with D614G mutation in the viral Spike protein, and S477N, located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, are associated with high fatality rates and are increasingly spreading throughout the world. The S477N variant arose quickly in Australia and experimental data support that this variant increases Spike protein fitness and its binding to ACE2. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 is evolving non-randomly, and human hosts shape emergent variants with positive fitness that can easily spread into the population. We propose that V1776F and S477N variants occurring in the Spike protein are two novel mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 and may pose significant public health concerns in the future.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_V1176F+SPIKE_D614G,SPIKE_S477N
9	10.1101/2020.11.10.20228528	We report the implementation of a two-step strategy for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the spike deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70). This spike deletion resulted in a S-gene target failure (SGTF) of a three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). Whole genome sequencing performed on 37 samples with SGTF revealed several receptor-binding domain mutations co-occurring with ΔH69/ΔV70. More importantly, this strategy enabled the first detection of the variant of concern 202012/01 in France on December 21th 2020.Since September a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70) has attracted increasing attention. This deletion was detected in the cluster-5 variant identified both in minks and humans in Denmark. This cluster-5 variant carries a receptor binding domain (RBD) mutation Y453F and was associated with reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies to sera from recovered COVID-19 patients [1–3]. The ΔH69/ΔV70 has also co-occurred with two other RBD mutations of increasing interest [4]: N439K that is currently spreading in Europe and might also have reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [5]; and N501Y that is part of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 recently detected in England [6]. Although the impact of ΔH69/ΔV70 on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is not clear, enhanced surveillance is urgently needed. Herein we report the implementation of a two-step strategy enabling a rapid detection of VOC 202012/01 or other variants carrying ΔH69/ΔV70.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70-
10	10.1101/2020.12.14.422555	SARS-CoV-2 amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain (RBD) occur relatively frequently and some have a consequence for immune recognition. Here we report recurrent emergence and significant onward transmission of a six-nucleotide out of frame deletion in the S gene, which results in loss of two amino acids: H69 and V70. We report that in human infections ΔH69/V70 often co-occurs with the receptor binding motif amino acid replacements N501Y, N439K and Y453F, and in the latter two cases has followed the RBD mutation. One of the ΔH69/V70+ N501Y lineages, now known as B.1.1.7, has undergone rapid expansion and includes eight S gene mutations: RBD (N501Y and A570D), S1 (ΔH69/V70 and Δ144) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H). In vitro, we show that ΔH69/V70 does not reduce serum neutralisation across multiple convalescent sera. However, ΔH69/V70 increases infectivity and is associated with increased incorporation of cleaved spike into virions. ΔH69/V70 is able to compensate for small infectivity defects induced by RBD mutations N501Y, N439K and Y453F. In addition, replacement of H69 and V70 residues in the B.1.1.7 spike reduces its infectivity and spike mediated cell-cell fusion. Based on our data ΔH69/V70 likely acts as a permissive mutation that allows acquisition of otherwise deleterious immune escape mutations. Enhanced surveillance for the ΔH69/V70 deletion with and without RBD mutations should be considered as a global priority not only as a marker for the B.1.1.7 variant, but potentially also for other emerging variants of concern. Vaccines designed to target the deleted spike protein could mitigate against its emergence as increased selective forces from immunity and vaccines increase globally. Highlights ΔH69/V70 is present in at least 28 SARS-CoV-2 lineages ΔH69/V70 does not confer escape from convalescent sera ΔH69/V70 increases spike infectivity and compensates for RBD mutations ΔH69/V70 is associated with greater spike cleavage B.1.1.7 requires ΔH69/V70 for optimal spike cleavage and infectivity	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70-

12	10.1101/2021.02.06.21251159	As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
13	10.1101/2021.02.14.431043	Wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is critical to tracking viral evolution during the ongoing pandemic. Variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil have spread to multiple countries. We developed the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detected an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020 when it represented <1% of sequenced coronavirus genomes that were collected in New York City (NYC). By February 2021, genomes from this lineage accounted for ~32% of 3288 sequenced genomes from NYC specimens. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage in NYC, notably the sub-clade defined by the spike mutation E484K, which has outpaced the growth of other variants in NYC. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, indicating the public health importance of this lineage.	mutation_name_list: B.1.526

We also find evidence of B.1.1.7's transmission advantage at warmer temperatures versus other strains, implying that spring conditions may facilitate B.1.1.7's invasion in Europe and across the Northern hemisphere, undermining the effectiveness of public health interventions.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
15	10.1101/2021.04.22.440932	As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome sequencing are being constantly used to investigate its transmissions and evolution. In the backdrop of the global emergence of “variants of concern” (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617 possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in the furin cleavage site, revealed that these may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better transmissibility. The same two RBD mutations indicated decreased binding to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization potential. Experimental validation against a wider panel of mAbs, sera from vaccinees and those that recovered from natural infection needs to be studied. The emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of convergent mutations during the COVID-19 second wave needs to be further investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and its possibility of becoming a VOC.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_L452R+SPIKE_E484Q+SPIKE_P681R,SPIKE_L452R+SPIKE_E484Q

In Denmark, comprehensive and real-time test, contact-tracing, and sequencing efforts were applied to sustain epidemic control. Here, we use these data to investigate the transmissibility, introduction, and onward transmission of B.1.1.7 in Denmark. In a period with stable restrictions, we estimated an increased B.1.1.7 transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%,60%]) relative to other lineages. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that 37% of B.1.1.7 cases were related to the initial introduction in November 2020. Continuous introductions contributed substantially to case numbers, highlighting the benefit of balanced travel restrictions and self-isolation procedures coupled with comprehensive surveillance efforts, to sustain epidemic control in the face of emerging variants.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7

In March 2020, Mauritius endured a small first wave and quickly implemented control measures which allowed elimination of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. When borders to the island reopened, it was accompanied by mandatory quarantine and testing of incoming passengers to avoid reintroduction of the virus into the community. As variants of concern (VOCs) emerged elsewhere in the world, Mauritius began using genomic surveillance to keep track of quarantined cases of these variants. In March 2021, another local outbreak occurred, and sequencing was used to investigate this new wave of local infections. Here, we analyze 154 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Mauritius, which represent 12% of all the infections seem in Mauritius, these were both from specimens of incoming passengers before March 2021 and those of cases during the second wave. Our findings indicate that despite the presence of known VOCs Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) among quarantined passengers, the second wave of local SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mauritius was caused by a single introduction and dominant circulation of the B.1.1.318 virus. The B.1.1.318 variant is characterized by fourteen non-synonymous mutations in the S-gene, with five encoded amino acid substitutions (T95I, E484K, D614G, P681H, D796H) and one deletion (Y144del) in the Spike glycoprotein. This variant seems to be increasing in prevalence and it is now present in 34 countries. This study highlights that despite having stopped the introduction of more transmissible VOCs by travel quarantines, a single undetected introduction of a B.1.1.318 lineage virus was enough to initiate a large local outbreak in Mauritius and demonstrated the need for continuous genomic surveillance to fully inform public health decisions.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.318
18	10.1101/2021.07.26.453518	Airborne transmission, a term combining both large droplet and aerosol transmission, is thought to be the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7
19	10.1101/2021.09.12.21263475	The significantly greater infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants of concern (VOC) is hypothesized to be driven by key mutations that result in increased transmissibility, viral load and/or evasion of host immune response. We surveyed the mutational profiles of Delta VOC genomes between September 2020 and mid-August 2021 and identified a previously unreported mutation pattern at amino acid position 142 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein which demonstrated multiple rounds of mutation from G142 to D142 and back. This pattern of frequent back mutations was observed at multiple time points and across Delta VOC sub-lineages. The etiology for these recurrent mutations is unclear but raises the possibility of host-directed editing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Within Delta VOC this mutation is associated with higher viral load, further enhanced in the presence of another NTD mutation (T95I) which was also frequently observed in these cases. Protein modeling of both mutations predicts alterations of the surface topography of the NTD by G142D, specifically disturbance of the 'super site' epitope that binds NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). The appearance of frequent and repeated G142D followed by D142G back mutations is previously unreported in SARS-CoV-2 and may represent viral adaptation to evolving host immunity characterized by increasing frequency of spike NAbs, from both prior infection and vaccine-based immunity. The emergence of alterations of the NTD in and around the main NAb epitope is a concerning development in the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to increased infectivity, immune evasion and 'breakthrough infections' characteristic of Delta VOC. Future vaccine and therapy development may benefit by recognizing the emergence of these novel spike NTD mutations and considering their impact on antibody recognition, viral neutralization, infectivity, replication, and viral load.	mutation_name_list: DELTA,SPIKE_G142D
20	10.1111/avj.13109	A highly transmissible severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) caused the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, which resulted the highest morbidity and mortality rates among SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV. SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant indicated the higher transmission among human‐to‐human and increasing hospitalisation. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was observed in domestic animals showing human‐to‐pet transmission. In the current study, we report the first direct known human‐to‐cat transmission of the SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant within the same family. Previous findings showed that companion animals can get infected by COVID‐19 patients after 3–6 weeks; however, according to our molecular findings, the cat was infected by the viral variant at the same period. Moreover, B.1.1.7 infection caused and developed several clinical symptoms including cardiac and ocular abnormalities. Overall, our findings determined the first direct and high transmission ability of the B.1.1.7 variant from COVID‐19 affected family members to cat. This result showed that the SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant could have the highest transition capacity from human to domestic cat as shown for human‐to‐human. The governmental or worldwide policies should consider more detailed against the war with COVID‐19 pandemic.	mutation_name_list: B.1.1.7

22	10.2147/idr.s320658	There is a concern that the spread of mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 will increase the number of severe COVID-19 patients and weaken vaccine effectiveness in the world. The mutants of the spike region of SARS-CoV-2, such as N501Y, E484K, P681H, and deletion H69/V70 (del 69/70), were studied in 25 COVID-19 patients admitted from December 2020 to April 2021; there were no patients with N501Y and P681H, but nine patients had E484K alone. Their symptoms, laboratory data, and course of their disease were similar to those of the other patients with the non-mutant virus. One patient with del69/70 alone showed prolonged inflammation, viral excretion, and late exacerbation 18 days after onset. Del69/70 may be independently associated with evasion of immunity, as previously reported, and it is present in Japan.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_E484K,SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70-

First, the spike (S) deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70), identified in certain SARS-CoV-2 variants including VOC, is screened for. This deletion is associated with a S-gene target failure (SGTF) in the three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). Subsequently, SGTF samples are whole genome sequenced. This approach revealed mutations co-occurring with ΔH69/ΔV70 including S:N501Y in the VOC.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70-
24	10.7554/elife.65365	A novel variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on wild-type human-codon-optimized Spike to introduce the D614G variant. Using multiple human cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, we found that the lentiviral particles pseudotyped with Spike D614G are more effective at transducing cells than ones pseudotyped with wild-type Spike. The increased transduction with Spike D614G ranged from 1.3- to 2.4-fold in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells expressing endogenous ACE2 and from 1.5- to 7.7-fold in A549ACE2 and Huh7.5ACE2 overexpressing ACE2. Furthermore, trans-complementation of SARS-CoV-2 virus with Spike D614G showed an increased infectivity in human cells. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the D614 and G614 Spike variants, the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction.	mutation_name_list: SPIKE_D614G

5	10.1016/j.antiviral.2021.105033	Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in ≥0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in ≥0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.	mutation_name: NSP12_P323L | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs
6	10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.052	The highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in the United Kingdom, has gained a foothold across the world. Using S gene target failure (SGTF) and SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing, we investigated the prevalence and dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 varied by state, the variant increased at a logistic rate with a roughly weekly doubling rate and an increased transmission of 40-50%. We revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with community transmission spreading it to most states within months. We show that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 became dominant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission

11	10.1016/j.jaut.2021.102715	Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been rapidly evolving in the form of new variants. At least eleven known variants have been reported. The objective of this study was to delineate the differences in the mutational profile of Delta and Delta Plus variants. High-quality sequences (n = 1756) of Delta (B.1.617.2) and Delta Plus (AY.1 or B.1.617.2.1) variants were used to determine the prevalence of mutations (≥20 %) in the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome, their co-existence, and change in prevalence over a period of time. Structural analysis was conducted to get insights into the impact of mutations on antibody binding. A Sankey diagram was generated using phylogenetic analysis coupled with sequence-acquisition dates to infer the migration of the Delta Plus variant and its presence in the United States. The Delta Plus variant had a significant number of high-prevalence mutations (≥20 %) than in the Delta variant. Signature mutations in Spike (G142D, A222V, and T95I) existed at a more significant percentage in the Delta Plus variant than the Delta variant. Three mutations in Spike (K417N, V70F, and W258L) were exclusively present in the Delta Plus variant. A new mutation was identified in ORF1a (A1146T), which was only present in the Delta Plus variant with ~58 % prevalence. Furthermore, five key mutations (T95I, A222V, G142D, R158G, and K417N) were significantly more prevalent in the Delta Plus than in the Delta variant. Structural analyses revealed that mutations alter the sidechain conformation to weaken the interactions with antibodies. Delta Plus, which first emerged in India, reached the United States through England and Japan, followed by its spread to more than 20 the United States. Based on the results presented here, it is clear that the Delta and Delta Plus variants have unique mutation profiles, and the Delta Plus variant is not just a simple addition of K417N to the Delta variant. Highly correlated mutations may have emerged to keep the structural integrity of the virus.	mutation_name: AY.1 | effect_list: binding_to_abs,protein_conformation
12	10.1016/j.jmb.2021.167051	The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered concerns about the emergence of more infectious and pathogenic viral strains. As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are structurally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S477N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (∼40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.	mutation_name: SPIKE_E484K | effect_list: binding_to_host_receptor

By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y.

23	10.1038/s41467-021-25168-4	Wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is critical to tracking viral evolution during the ongoing pandemic. We develop the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detect an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage. In concert with other variants, like B.1.1.7, the rise of B.1.526 appears to have extended the duration of the second wave of COVID-19 cases in NYC in early 2021. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, supporting the public health relevance of this lineage.	mutation_name: B.1.526 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera,sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera,viral_transmission

26	10.1101/2020.10.23.20218511	Abstract Background We aimed to further characterize and analyze in depth intra-host variation and founder variants of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide up until August 2020, by examining in excess of 94,000 SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences in order to understand SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution, how these variants arose and identify any increased mortality associated with these variants. Methods and Findings We combined worldwide sequencing data from GISAID and Sequence Read Archive (SRA) repositories and discovered SARS-CoV-2 hypermutation occurring in less than 2% of COVID19 patients, likely caused by host mechanisms involved APOBEC3G complexes and intra-host microdiversity. Most of this intra-host variation occurring in SARS-CoV-2 are predicted to change viral proteins with defined variant signatures, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be actively shaped by the host immune system to varying degrees. At the global population level, several SARS-CoV-2 proteins such as Nsp2, 3C-like proteinase, ORF3a and ORF8 are under active evolution, as evidenced by their increased πN/πS ratios per geographical region. Importantly, two emergent variants: V1176F in co-occurrence with D614G mutation in the viral Spike protein, and S477N, located in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, are associated with high fatality rates and are increasingly spreading throughout the world. The S477N variant arose quickly in Australia and experimental data support that this variant increases Spike protein fitness and its binding to ACE2. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 is evolving non-randomly, and human hosts shape emergent variants with positive fitness that can easily spread into the population. We propose that V1776F and S477N variants occurring in the Spike protein are two novel mutations occurring in SARS-CoV-2 and may pose significant public health concerns in the future.	mutation_name: SPIKE_S477N | effect_list: viral_transmission,binding_to_host_receptor,fatality_rate,protein_functionality

28	10.1101/2020.11.10.20228528	We report the implementation of a two-step strategy for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying the spike deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70). This spike deletion resulted in a S-gene target failure (SGTF) of a three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). Whole genome sequencing performed on 37 samples with SGTF revealed several receptor-binding domain mutations co-occurring with ΔH69/ΔV70. More importantly, this strategy enabled the first detection of the variant of concern 202012/01 in France on December 21th 2020.Since September a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70) has attracted increasing attention. This deletion was detected in the cluster-5 variant identified both in minks and humans in Denmark. This cluster-5 variant carries a receptor binding domain (RBD) mutation Y453F and was associated with reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies to sera from recovered COVID-19 patients [1–3]. The ΔH69/ΔV70 has also co-occurred with two other RBD mutations of increasing interest [4]: N439K that is currently spreading in Europe and might also have reduced susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [5]; and N501Y that is part of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 recently detected in England [6]. Although the impact of ΔH69/ΔV70 on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis is not clear, enhanced surveillance is urgently needed. Herein we report the implementation of a two-step strategy enabling a rapid detection of VOC 202012/01 or other variants carrying ΔH69/ΔV70.	mutation_name: SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70- | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics
29	10.1101/2020.12.14.422555	SARS-CoV-2 amino acid replacements in the receptor binding domain (RBD) occur relatively frequently and some have a consequence for immune recognition. Here we report recurrent emergence and significant onward transmission of a six-nucleotide out of frame deletion in the S gene, which results in loss of two amino acids: H69 and V70. We report that in human infections ΔH69/V70 often co-occurs with the receptor binding motif amino acid replacements N501Y, N439K and Y453F, and in the latter two cases has followed the RBD mutation. One of the ΔH69/V70+ N501Y lineages, now known as B.1.1.7, has undergone rapid expansion and includes eight S gene mutations: RBD (N501Y and A570D), S1 (ΔH69/V70 and Δ144) and S2 (P681H, T716I, S982A and D1118H). In vitro, we show that ΔH69/V70 does not reduce serum neutralisation across multiple convalescent sera. However, ΔH69/V70 increases infectivity and is associated with increased incorporation of cleaved spike into virions. ΔH69/V70 is able to compensate for small infectivity defects induced by RBD mutations N501Y, N439K and Y453F. In addition, replacement of H69 and V70 residues in the B.1.1.7 spike reduces its infectivity and spike mediated cell-cell fusion. Based on our data ΔH69/V70 likely acts as a permissive mutation that allows acquisition of otherwise deleterious immune escape mutations. Enhanced surveillance for the ΔH69/V70 deletion with and without RBD mutations should be considered as a global priority not only as a marker for the B.1.1.7 variant, but potentially also for other emerging variants of concern. Vaccines designed to target the deleted spike protein could mitigate against its emergence as increased selective forces from immunity and vaccines increase globally. Highlights ΔH69/V70 is present in at least 28 SARS-CoV-2 lineages ΔH69/V70 does not confer escape from convalescent sera ΔH69/V70 increases spike infectivity and compensates for RBD mutations ΔH69/V70 is associated with greater spike cleavage B.1.1.7 requires ΔH69/V70 for optimal spike cleavage and infectivity	mutation_name: SPIKE_H69-+SPIKE_V70- | effect_list: infectivity,viral_fitness
30	10.1101/2020.12.19.423600	Remdesivir (RDV) exhibits potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and is currently the only drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, little is currently known about the potential for pre-existing resistance to RDV and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification that might impact RDV efficacy as the virus continue to spread globally. In this study, >90,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from globally circulating clinical isolates, including sequences from recently emerged United Kingdom and South Africa variants, and >300 from mink isolates were analyzed for genetic diversity in the RNA replication complex (nsp7, nsp8, nsp10, nsp12, nsp13, and nsp14) with a focus on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the molecular target of RDV. Overall, low genetic variation was observed with only 12 amino acid substitutions present in the entire RNA replication complex in ≥0.5% of analyzed sequences with the highest overall frequency (82.2%) observed for nsp12 P323L that consistently increased over time. Low sequence variation in the RNA replication complex was also observed among the mink isolates. Importantly, the coronavirus Nsp12 mutations previously selected in vitro in the presence of RDV were identified in only 2 isolates (0.002%) within all the analyzed sequences. In addition, among the sequence variants observed in ≥0.5% clinical isolates, including P323L, none were located near the established polymerase active site or sites critical for the RDV mechanism of inhibition. In summary, the low diversity and high genetic stability of the RNA replication complex observed over time and in the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants suggests a minimal global risk of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 resistance to RDV.	mutation_name: NSP12_P323L | effect_list: effectiveness_of_available_antiviral_drugs
31	10.1101/2021.02.06.21251159	As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January 2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission,effectiveness_of_available_diagnostics
32	10.1101/2021.02.14.431043	Wide-scale SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing is critical to tracking viral evolution during the ongoing pandemic. Variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil have spread to multiple countries. We developed the software tool, Variant Database (VDB), for quickly examining the changing landscape of spike mutations. Using VDB, we detected an emerging lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the New York region that shares mutations with previously reported variants. The most common sets of spike mutations in this lineage (now designated as B.1.526) are L5F, T95I, D253G, E484K or S477N, D614G, and A701V. This lineage was first sequenced in late November 2020 when it represented <1% of sequenced coronavirus genomes that were collected in New York City (NYC). By February 2021, genomes from this lineage accounted for ~32% of 3288 sequenced genomes from NYC specimens. Phylodynamic inference confirmed the rapid growth of the B.1.526 lineage in NYC, notably the sub-clade defined by the spike mutation E484K, which has outpaced the growth of other variants in NYC. Pseudovirus neutralization experiments demonstrated that B.1.526 spike mutations adversely affect the neutralization titer of convalescent and vaccinee plasma, indicating the public health importance of this lineage.	mutation_name: B.1.526 | effect_list: sensitivity_to_convalescent_sera,sensitivity_to_vaccinated_sera,viral_transmission
33	10.1101/2021.03.09.21253242	Previous work has shown that environment affects SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but it is unclear whether emerging strains show similar responses. Here we show that lineage B.1.1.7 spread with greater transmission in colder and more densely populated parts of England. We also find evidence of B.1.1.7's transmission advantage at warmer temperatures versus other strains, implying that spring conditions may facilitate B.1.1.7's invasion in Europe and across the Northern hemisphere, undermining the effectiveness of public health interventions.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission
34	10.1101/2021.04.22.440932	As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome sequencing are being constantly used to investigate its transmissions and evolution. In the backdrop of the global emergence of “variants of concern” (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches was undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of current circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the predominant clade in circulation was a distinct newly identified lineage B.1.617 possessing common signature mutations D111D, G142D, L452R, E484Q, D614G and P681R, in the spike protein including within the receptor binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R and E484Q along with P681R in the furin cleavage site, revealed that these may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding and rate of S1-S2 cleavage resulting in better transmissibility. The same two RBD mutations indicated decreased binding to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization potential. Experimental validation against a wider panel of mAbs, sera from vaccinees and those that recovered from natural infection needs to be studied. The emergence of such local variants through the accumulation of convergent mutations during the COVID-19 second wave needs to be further investigated for their public health impact in the rest of the country and its possibility of becoming a VOC.	mutation_name: SPIKE_L452R+SPIKE_E484Q | effect_list: binding_to_abs,sensitivity_to_mabs

36	10.1101/2021.06.04.21258333	In early 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 became dominant across large parts of the world. In Denmark, comprehensive and real-time test, contact-tracing, and sequencing efforts were applied to sustain epidemic control. Here, we use these data to investigate the transmissibility, introduction, and onward transmission of B.1.1.7 in Denmark. In a period with stable restrictions, we estimated an increased B.1.1.7 transmissibility of 58% (95% CI: [56%,60%]) relative to other lineages. Epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses revealed that 37% of B.1.1.7 cases were related to the initial introduction in November 2020. Continuous introductions contributed substantially to case numbers, highlighting the benefit of balanced travel restrictions and self-isolation procedures coupled with comprehensive surveillance efforts, to sustain epidemic control in the face of emerging variants.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission
37	10.1101/2021.06.16.21259017	Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean, has had a unique experience of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In March 2020, Mauritius endured a small first wave and quickly implemented control measures which allowed elimination of local transmission of SARS-CoV-2. When borders to the island reopened, it was accompanied by mandatory quarantine and testing of incoming passengers to avoid reintroduction of the virus into the community. As variants of concern (VOCs) emerged elsewhere in the world, Mauritius began using genomic surveillance to keep track of quarantined cases of these variants. In March 2021, another local outbreak occurred, and sequencing was used to investigate this new wave of local infections. Here, we analyze 154 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from Mauritius, which represent 12% of all the infections seem in Mauritius, these were both from specimens of incoming passengers before March 2021 and those of cases during the second wave. Our findings indicate that despite the presence of known VOCs Beta (B.1.351) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) among quarantined passengers, the second wave of local SARS-CoV-2 infections in Mauritius was caused by a single introduction and dominant circulation of the B.1.1.318 virus. The B.1.1.318 variant is characterized by fourteen non-synonymous mutations in the S-gene, with five encoded amino acid substitutions (T95I, E484K, D614G, P681H, D796H) and one deletion (Y144del) in the Spike glycoprotein. This variant seems to be increasing in prevalence and it is now present in 34 countries. This study highlights that despite having stopped the introduction of more transmissible VOCs by travel quarantines, a single undetected introduction of a B.1.1.318 lineage virus was enough to initiate a large local outbreak in Mauritius and demonstrated the need for continuous genomic surveillance to fully inform public health decisions.	mutation_name: B.1.1.318 | effect_list: viral_transmission
38	10.1101/2021.07.26.453518	Airborne transmission, a term combining both large droplet and aerosol transmission, is thought to be the main transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Here we investigated the relative efficiency of aerosol transmission of two variants of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 (alpha) and lineage A, in the Syrian hamster. A novel transmission caging setup was designed and validated, which allowed the assessment of transmission efficiency at various distances. At 2 meters distance, only particles <5 μm traversed between cages. In this setup, aerosol transmission was confirmed in 8 out of 8 (N = 4 for each variant) sentinels after 24 hours of exposure as demonstrated by respiratory shedding and seroconversion. Successful transmission occurred even when exposure time was limited to one hour, highlighting the efficiency of this transmission route. Interestingly, the B.1.1.7 variant outcompeted the lineage A variant in an airborne transmission chain after mixed infection of donors. Combined, this data indicates that the infectious dose of B.1.1.7 required for successful transmission may be lower than that of lineage A virus. The experimental proof for true aerosol transmission and the increase in the aerosol transmission potential of B.1.1.7 underscore the continuous need for assessment of novel variants and the development or preemptive transmission mitigation strategies.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission
39	10.1101/2021.09.12.21263475	The significantly greater infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants of concern (VOC) is hypothesized to be driven by key mutations that result in increased transmissibility, viral load and/or evasion of host immune response. We surveyed the mutational profiles of Delta VOC genomes between September 2020 and mid-August 2021 and identified a previously unreported mutation pattern at amino acid position 142 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein which demonstrated multiple rounds of mutation from G142 to D142 and back. This pattern of frequent back mutations was observed at multiple time points and across Delta VOC sub-lineages. The etiology for these recurrent mutations is unclear but raises the possibility of host-directed editing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Within Delta VOC this mutation is associated with higher viral load, further enhanced in the presence of another NTD mutation (T95I) which was also frequently observed in these cases. Protein modeling of both mutations predicts alterations of the surface topography of the NTD by G142D, specifically disturbance of the 'super site' epitope that binds NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). The appearance of frequent and repeated G142D followed by D142G back mutations is previously unreported in SARS-CoV-2 and may represent viral adaptation to evolving host immunity characterized by increasing frequency of spike NAbs, from both prior infection and vaccine-based immunity. The emergence of alterations of the NTD in and around the main NAb epitope is a concerning development in the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to increased infectivity, immune evasion and 'breakthrough infections' characteristic of Delta VOC. Future vaccine and therapy development may benefit by recognizing the emergence of these novel spike NTD mutations and considering their impact on antibody recognition, viral neutralization, infectivity, replication, and viral load.	mutation_name: DELTA | effect_list: viral_transmission,infectivity

41	10.1111/avj.13109	A highly transmissible severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) caused the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic, which resulted the highest morbidity and mortality rates among SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV. SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant indicated the higher transmission among human‐to‐human and increasing hospitalisation. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was observed in domestic animals showing human‐to‐pet transmission. In the current study, we report the first direct known human‐to‐cat transmission of the SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant within the same family. Previous findings showed that companion animals can get infected by COVID‐19 patients after 3–6 weeks; however, according to our molecular findings, the cat was infected by the viral variant at the same period. Moreover, B.1.1.7 infection caused and developed several clinical symptoms including cardiac and ocular abnormalities. Overall, our findings determined the first direct and high transmission ability of the B.1.1.7 variant from COVID‐19 affected family members to cat. This result showed that the SARS‐CoV‐2 B.1.1.7 variant could have the highest transition capacity from human to domestic cat as shown for human‐to‐human. The governmental or worldwide policies should consider more detailed against the war with COVID‐19 pandemic.	mutation_name: B.1.1.7 | effect_list: viral_transmission,risk_of_hospitalization,disease_severity

Their symptoms, laboratory data, and course of their disease were similar to those of the other patients with the non-mutant virus. One patient with del69/70 alone showed prolonged inflammation, viral excretion, and late exacerbation 18 days after onset.

First, the spike (S) deletion H69-V70 (ΔH69/ΔV70), identified in certain SARS-CoV-2 variants including VOC, is screened for. This deletion is associated with a S-gene target failure (SGTF) in the three-target RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit). Subsequently, SGTF samples are whole genome sequenced.

46	10.7554/elife.65365	A novel variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus carrying a point mutation in the Spike protein (D614G) has recently emerged and rapidly surpassed others in prevalence. This mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with an ORF1b protein variant (P314L), making it difficult to discern the functional significance of the Spike D614G mutation from population genetics alone. Here, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on wild-type human-codon-optimized Spike to introduce the D614G variant. Using multiple human cell lines, including human lung epithelial cells, we found that the lentiviral particles pseudotyped with Spike D614G are more effective at transducing cells than ones pseudotyped with wild-type Spike. The increased transduction with Spike D614G ranged from 1.3- to 2.4-fold in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells expressing endogenous ACE2 and from 1.5- to 7.7-fold in A549ACE2 and Huh7.5ACE2 overexpressing ACE2. Furthermore, trans-complementation of SARS-CoV-2 virus with Spike D614G showed an increased infectivity in human cells. Although there is minimal difference in ACE2 receptor binding between the D614 and G614 Spike variants, the G614 variant is more resistant to proteolytic cleavage, suggesting a possible mechanism for the increased transduction.	mutation_name: SPIKE_D614G | effect_list: infectivity,binding_to_host_receptor,protein_conformation
